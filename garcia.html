Colonel Aureliano Buendfa was to remember that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions. First they brought the magnet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquiades, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put on a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned al&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chemists of Macedonia. He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots and everybody was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time appeared from where they had been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confusion behind Melquiades&rsquo; magical irons. &ldquo;Things have a life of their own,&rdquo; the gypsy proclaimed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a harsh accent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply a matter of waking up their souls.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia, whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond miracles and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">magic, thought that it would be possible to make use of that useless invention to extract gold from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bowels of the earth. Melquiades, who was an honest man, warned him: &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that.&rdquo; But Jose Arcadio Buendia at that time did not believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Iris mule and a pair of goats for the two magnetized ingots. Ursula Iguaran, his wife, who relied on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those animals to increase their poor domestic holdings, was unable to dissuade him. &ldquo;Very soon well </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house,&rdquo; her husband replied. For several </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months he worked hard to demonstrate the truth of his idea. He explored every inch of the region, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reciting Melquiades&rsquo; incantation aloud. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit of fifteenth-century armor which had all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of its pieces soldered together with rust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enormous stone-filled gourd. When Jose Arcadio Buendia and the four men of his expedition </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">managed to take the armor apart, they found inside a calcified skeleton with a copper locket </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">containing a woman&rsquo;s hair around its neck. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In March the gypsies returned. This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying glass the size </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a dmm, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of Amsterdam. They placed a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance to the tent. For the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">price of five reales, people could look into the telescope and see the gypsy woman an arm&rsquo;s length </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">away. &ldquo;Science has eliminated distance,&rdquo; Melquiades proclaimed. &ldquo;In a short time, man will be able </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to see what is happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house.&rdquo; A burning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">noonday sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they put a pile </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun&rsquo;s rays. Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa, who had still not been consoled for the failure of big magnets, conceived the idea of using </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that invention as a weapon of war. Again Melquiades tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the two magnetized ingots and three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wept in consternation. That money was from a chest of gold coins that her father had put together </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ova an entire life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">occasion to make use of it. Jose Arcadio Buendfa made no at. tempt to console her, completely </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abnegation of a scientist and even at the risk of his own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">life. In an attempt to show the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concentration of the sun&rsquo;s rays and suffered burns which turned into sores that took a long time to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heal. Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at such a dangerous invention, at one point he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was ready to set the house on fire. He would spend hours on end in his room, calculating the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strategic possibilities of his novel weapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">startling instructional clarity and an irresistible power of conviction. He sent it to the government, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accompanied by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sketches; by a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in measureless swamps, forded stormy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rivers, and was on the point of perishing under the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts until he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found a route that joined the one used by the mules that carried the mail. In spite of the fact that a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trip to the capital was little less than impossible at that time, Jose Arcadio Buendia promised to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so that he could put on some practical </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could train them himself in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complicated art of solar war. For several years he waited for an answer. Finally, tired of waiting, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bemoaned to Melquiades the failure of Iris project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing proof </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him in addition some Portuguese maps and several instruments of navigation. In his own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann, which he left Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant. Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia spent the long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the rear of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments. Having completely aban&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doned Iris domestic obligations, he spent entire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stars and he almost contracted sunstroke from trying to establish an exact method to ascertain noon. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he became an expert in the use and manipulation of his instmments, he conceived a notion of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">space that allowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study. That was the period in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which he acquired the habit of talking to himself, of walking through the house without paying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention to anyone, as Ursula and the children broke their backs in the garden, growing banana and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eggplants. Suddenly, without warning, his feverish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">activity was intermpted and was replaced by a kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were bewitched, softly repeating to himself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">own understanding. Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, all at once he released the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whole weight of Iris torment. The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solemnity with which their father, devastated by his prolonged vigil and by the wrath of Iris </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">imagination, revealed his discovery to them: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The earth is round, like an orange.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula lost her patience. &ldquo;If you have to go crazy, please go crazy all by yourself!&rdquo; she shouted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t try to put your gypsy ideas into the heads of the children.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the desperation of his wife, who, in a seizure of rage, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mashed the astrolabe against the floor. He built another one, he gathered the men of the village in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Iris little room, and he demonstrated to them, with theories that none of them could understand, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">possibility of returning to where one had set out by consistently sailing east. The whole village was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced that Jose Arcadio Buendia had lost his reason, when Melquiades returned to set things </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">straight. He gave public praise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astronomical speculation </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had evolved a theory that had already been proved in practice, although unknown in Macondo until </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was to have a profound influence on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the future of the village: the laboratory of an alchemist. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">9 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By then Melquiades had aged with surprising rapidity. On his first trips he seemed to be the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">age as Jose Arcadio Buendia. But while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength, which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">permitted him to pull down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by some tenacious illness. It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted on his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">innumerable trips around the world. According to what he himself said as he spoke to Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cuffs of his pants, but never deciding to give him the final clutch of its claws. He was a fugitive from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankind. He had survived pellagra in Persia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, bubonic plague in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disastrous shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan. That </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prodigious creature, said to possess the keys of Nostradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">aura, with an Asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of tilings. He wore </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a large black hat that looked like a raven with widespread wings, and a velvet vest across which the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patina of the centuries had skated. But in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he had a human burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">life. He would complain of the ailments of old age, he suffered from the most insignificant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">economic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long time back because scurvy had made his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">teeth drop out. On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets, Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia had the certainty that it was the beginning of a great friendship. The children were startled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by his fantastic stories. Aureliano, who could not have been more than five at the time, would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">quivering light from the window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest reaches of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">imagination, while down over his temples there flowed the grease that was being melted by the heat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Iris descendants. Ursula on the other hand, held a bad memory of that visit, for she had entered the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room just as Melquiades had carelessly broken a flask of bichloride of mercury. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the smell of the devil,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Melquiades corrected her. &ldquo;It has been proven that the devil has sulphuric properties </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and this is just a little corrosive sublimate.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Always didactic, he went into a learned exposition of the diabolical properties of cinnabar, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula paid no attention to him, although she took the children off to pray. That biting odor would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquiades. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mdimentary laboratory&mdash;in addition to a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sieves&mdash;was made up of a primitive water pipe, a glass beaker with a long, thin neck, a reproduction </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the philosopher&rsquo;s egg, and a still the gypsies themselves had built in accordance with modern </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">descriptions of the three-armed alembic of Mary the Jew. Along with those items, Melquiades left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">samples of the seven metals that corresponded to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and a set of notes and sketches concerning the processes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the Great Teaching that would permit those who could interpret them to undertake the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manufacture of the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">quantity of gold, Jose Arcadio Buendia paid court to Ursula for several weeks so that she would let </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him dig up her colonial coins and increase them by as many times as it was possible to subdivide </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mercury. Ursula gave in, as always, to her husband&rsquo;s unyielding obstinacy. Then Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a thick and pestilential syrup which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was more like common caramel than valuable gold. In risky and desperate processes of distillation, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">melted with the seven planetary metals, mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of Cypms, and put </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">10 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back to cook in hog fat for lack of any radish oil, Ursula&rsquo;s precious inheritance was reduced to a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">large piece of burnt hog cracklings that was firmly stuck to the bottom of the pot. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the gypsies came back, Ursula had turned the whole population of the village against them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But curiosity was greater than fear, for that time the gypsies went about the town making a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deafening noise with all manner of musical instruments while a hawker announced the exhibition of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the most fabulous discovery of the Naciancenes. So that everyone went to the tent and by paying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one cent they saw a youthful Melquiades, recovered, unwrinkled, with a new and flashing set of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">teeth. Those who remembered his gums that had been destroyed by scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his withered lips trembled with fear at the final proof of the gypsy&rsquo;s supernatural power. The fear </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">turned into panic when Melquiades took out his teeth, intact, encased in their gums, and showed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them to the audience for an instant&mdash;a fleeting instant in which he went back to being the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decrepit man of years past&mdash;and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his restored youth. Even Jose Arcadio Buendia himself considered that Melquiades&rsquo; knowledge had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reached unbearable extremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when the gypsy explained to him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">atone the workings of his false teeth. It seemed so simple and so prodigious at the same time that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">overnight he lost all interest in his experiments in alchemy. He underwent a new crisis of bad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">humor. He did not go back to eating regularly, and he would spend the day walking through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house. &ldquo;Incredible things are happening in the world,&rdquo; he said to Ursula. &ldquo;Right there across the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">river there are all kinds of magical instmments while we keep on living like donkeys.&rdquo; Those who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had known him since the foundation of Macondo were startled at how much he had changed under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades&rsquo; influence. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first Jose Arcadio Buendia had been a kind of youthful patriarch who would give instructions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for planting and advice for the raising of children and animals, and who collaborated with everyone, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even in the physical work, for the welfare of the community. Since his house from the very first had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been the best in the village, the others had been built in its image and likeness. It had a small, well- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lighted living roost, a dining room in the shape of a terrace with gaily colored flowers, two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedrooms, a courtyard with a gigantic chestnut tree, a well kept garden, and a corral where goats, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pigs, and hens lived in peaceful communion. The only animals that were prohibited, not just in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house but in the entire settlement, were fighting cocks. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula&rsquo;s capacity for work was the same as that of her husband. Active, small, severe, that woman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of unbreakable nerves who at no moment in her life had been heard to sing seemed to be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everywhere, from dawn until quite late at night, always pursued by the soft whispering of her stiff, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">starched petticoats. Thanks to her the floors of tamped earth, the unwhitewashed mud walls, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rustic, wooden furniture they had built themselves were always dean, and the old chests where they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kept their clothes exhaled the warm smell of basil. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia, who was the most enterprising man ever to be seen in the village, had set </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up the placement of the houses in such a way that from all of them one could reach the river and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">draw water with the same effort, and he had lined up the streets with such good sense that no house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">got more sun than another during the hot time of day. Within a few years Macondo was a village </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was more orderly and hard working than any known until then by its three hundred inhabitants. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a truly happy village where no one was over thirty years of age and where no one had died. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the time of its founding, Jose Arcadio Buendia had built traps and cages. In a short time he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">filled not only his own house but all of those in the village with troupials, canaries, bee eaters, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">redbreasts. The concert of so many different birds became so disturbing that Ursula would plug her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ears with beeswax so as not to lose her sense of reality. The first time that Melquiades&rsquo; tribe arrived, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">selling glass balls for headaches, everyone was surprised that they had been able to find that village </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lost in the drowsiness of the swamp, and the gypsies confessed that they had found their way by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">song of the birds. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">11 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That spirit of social initiative disappeared in a short time, pulled away by the fever of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">magnets, the astronomical calculations, the dreams of transmutation, and the urge to discover the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wonders of the world. From a clean and active man, Jose Arcadio Buendia changed into a man lazy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in appearance, careless in his dress, with a wild beard that Ursula managed to trim with great effort </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and a kitchen knife. There were many who considered him the victim of some strange spell. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even those most convinced of his madness left work and family to follow him when he brought out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his tools to clear the land and asked the assembled group to open a way that would put Macondo in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contact with the great inventions. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia was completely ignorant of the geography of the region. He knew that to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the east there lay an impenetrable mountain chain and that on the other side of the mountains there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was the ardent city of Riohacha, where in times past&mdash;according to what he had been told by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first Aureliano Buendia, his grandfather&mdash;Sir Francis Drake had gone crocodile hunting with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to Queen Elizabeth. In his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">youth, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his men, with wives and children, animals and all kinds of domestic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">implements, had crossed the mountains in search of an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months they gave up the expedition and founded Macondo, so they would not have to go back. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, for it could lead only to the past. To the south lay </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the swamps, covered with an eternal vegetable scum and the whole vast universe of the great </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">swamp, which, according to what the gypsies said, had no limits. The great swamp in the west </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mingled with a boundless extension of water where there were soft-skinned cetaceans that had the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">head and torso of a woman, causing the ruination of sailors with the charm of their extraordinary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">breasts. The gypsies sailed along that route for six months before they reached the strip of land over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which the mules that carried the mail passed. According to Jose Arcadio Buendia&rsquo;s calculations, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only possibility of contact with civilization lay along the northern route. So he handed out clearing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tools and hunting weapons to the same men who had been with him during the founding of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo. He threw his directional instruments and his maps into a knapsack, and he undertook the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reckless adventure. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the first days they did not come across any appreciable obstacle. They went down along </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the stony bank of the river to the place where years before they had found the soldier&rsquo;s armor, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from there they went into the woods along a path between wild orange trees. At the end of the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">week they killed and roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half of it and salt the rest for the days </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that lay ahead. With that precaution they tried to postpone the necessity of having to eat macaws, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whose blue flesh had a harsh and musky taste. Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sun again. The ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was thicker and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thicker, and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the monkeys became more and more remote, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the world became eternally sad. The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ancient memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to before original sin, as their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salaman&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ders. For a week, almost without speaking, they went ahead like sleepwalkers through a universe of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grief, lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects, and their lungs were overwhelmed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by a suffocating smell of blood. They could not return because the strip that they were opening as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they went along would soon close up with a new vegetation that, almost seemed to grow before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia would say. &ldquo;The main tiling is not to lose our </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bearings.&rdquo; Always following his compass, he kept on guiding his men toward the invisible north so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that they would be able to get out of that enchanted region. It was a thick night, starless, but the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">darkness was becoming impregnated with a fresh and clear air. Exhausted by the long crossing, they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hung up their hammocks and slept deeply for the first time in two weeks. When they woke up, with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the sun already high in the sky, they were speechless with fascination. Before them, surrounded by </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">12 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the midst of its rigging, which was adorned with orchids. The hull, covered with an armor of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">petrified barnacles and soft moss, was firmly fastened into a surface of stones. The whole structure </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seemed to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the habits of the birds. Inside, where the expeditionaries explored with careful intent, there was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nothing but a thick forest of flowers. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The discovery of the galleon, an indication of the proximity of the sea, broke Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia&rsquo;s drive. He considered it a trick of his whimsical fate to have searched for the sea without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finding it, at the cost of countless sacrifices and suffering, and to have found it all of a sudden </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without looking for it, as if it lay across his path like an insurmountable object. Many years later </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia crossed the region again, when it was already a regular mail route, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the only part of the ship he found was its burned-out frame in the midst of a field of poppies. Only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then, convinced that the story had not been some product of his father&rsquo;s imagination, did he wonder </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">how the galleon had been able to get inland to that spot. But Jose Arcadio Buendia did not concern </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself with that when he found the sea after another four days&rsquo; journey from the galleon. His </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dreams ended as he faced that ashen, foamy, dirty sea, which had not merited the risks and sacrifices </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the adventure. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;God damn it!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Macondo is surrounded by water on all sides.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea of a peninsular Macondo prevailed for a long time, inspired by the arbitrary map that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia sketched on his return from the expedition. He drew it in rage, evilly, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exaggerating the difficulties of communication, as if to punish himself for the absolute lack of sense </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with which he had chosen the place. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get anywhere,&rdquo; he lamented to Ursula. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">going to rot our lives away here without receiving the benefits of science.&rdquo; That certainty, mulled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over for several months in the small room he used as his laboratory, brought him to the conception </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the plan to move Maeondo to a better place. But that time Ursula had anticipated his feverish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">designs. With the secret and implacable labor of a small ant she predisposed the women of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">village against the flightiness of their husbands, who were already preparing for the move. Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia did not know at what moment or because of what adverse forces his plan had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">become enveloped in a web of pretexts, disappointments, and evasions until it turned into nothing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but an illusion. Ursula watched him with innocent attention and even felt some pity for him on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morning when she found him in the back room muttering about his plans for moving as he placed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his laboratory pieces in their original boxes. She let him finish. She let him nail up the boxes and put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his initials on them with an inked brush, without reproaching him, but knowing now that he knew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(because she had heard him say so in his soft monologues) that the men of the village would not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back him up in his undertaking. Only when he began to take down the door of the room did Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dare ask him what he was doing, and he answered with a certain bitterness. &ldquo;Since no one wants to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leave, we&rsquo;ll leave all by ourselves.&rdquo; Ursula did not become upset. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will not leave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We will stay here, because we have had a son here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have still not had a death,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A person does not belong to a place until there is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">someone dead under the ground.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula replied with a soft firmness: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I have to die for the rest of you to stay here, I will die.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia had not thought that his wife&rsquo;s will was so firm. He tried to seduce her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the charm of his fantasy, with the promise of a prodigious world where all one had to do was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sprinkle some magic liquid on the ground and the plants would bear fmit whenever a man wished, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and where all manner of instruments against pain were sold at bargain prices. But Ursula was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insensible to his clairvoyance. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">13 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Instead of going around thinking about your crazy inventions, you should be worrying about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">your sons,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Look at the state they&rsquo;re in, running wild just like donkeys.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia took his wife&rsquo;s words literally. He looked out the window and saw the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barefoot children in the sunny garden and he had the impression that only at that instant had they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">begun to exist, conceived by Ursula&rsquo;s spell, Something occurred inside of him then, something </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mysterious and definitive that uprooted him from his own time and carried him adrift through an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unexplored region of his memory. While Ursula continued sweeping the house, which was safe now </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from being abandoned for the rest of her life, he stood there with an absorbed look, contemplating </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the children until his eyes became moist and he dried them with the back of Inis hand, exhaling a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deep sigh of resignation. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell them to come help me take the things out of the boxes.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio, the older of the children, was fourteen. He had a square head, thick hair, and his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">father&rsquo;s character. Although he had the same impulse for growth and physical strength, it was early </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">evident that he lacked imagination. He had been conceived and born during the difficult crossing of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the mountains, before the founding of Macondo, and his parents gave thanks to heaven when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saw he had no animal features. Aureliano, the first human being to be born in Macondo, would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">six years old in March. He was silent and withdrawn. He had wept in his mother&rsquo;s womb and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been born with his eyes open. As they were cutting the umbilical cord, he moved his head from side </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to side, taking in the tilings in the room and examining the faces of the people with a fearless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">curiosity. Then, indifferent to those who came close to look at him, he kept his attention </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concentrated on the palm roof, which looked as if it were about to collapse under the tremendous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pressure of the rain. Ursula did not remember the intensity of that look again until one day when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">little Aureliano, at the age of three, went into the kitchen at the moment she was taking a pot of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">boiling soup from the stove and putting it on the table. The child. Perplexed, said from the doorway, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to spill.&rdquo; The pot was firmly placed in the center of the table, but just as soon as the child </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made his announcement, it began an unmistakable movement toward the edge, as if impelled by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">some inner dynamism, and it fell and broke on the floor. Ursula, alarmed, told her husband about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the episode, but he interpreted it as a natural phenomenon. That was the way he always was alien to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the existence of his sons, partly because he considered childhood as a period of mental insufficiency, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and partly because he was always too absorbed in his fantastic speculations. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But since the afternoon when he called the children in to help him unpack the things in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laboratory, he gave them his best hours. In the small separate room, where the walls were gradually </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being covered by strange maps and fabulous drawings, he taught them to read and write and do </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sums, and he spoke to them about the wonders of the world, not only where his learning had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">extended, but forcing the limits of his imagination to extremes. It was in that way that the boys </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ended up learning that in the southern extremes of Africa there were men so intelligent and peaceful </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that their only pastime was to sit and think, and that it was possible to cross the Aegean Sea on foot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by jumping from island to island all the way to the port of Salonika. Those hallucinating sessions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remained printed on the memories of the boys in such a way that many years later, a second before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the regular army officer gave the firing squad the command to fire. Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">once more that warm March afternoon on which his father had intermpted the lesson in physics and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stood fascinated, with his hand in the air and his eyes motionless, listening to the distant pipes, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drums, and jingles of the gypsies, who were coming to the village once more, announcing the latest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and most startling discovery of the sages of Memphis. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were new gypsies, young men and women who knew only their own language, handsome </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">specimens with oily skins and intelligent hands, whose dances and music sowed a panic of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">uproarious joy through the streets, with parrots painted all colors reciting Italian arias, and a hen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who laid a hundred golden eggs to the sound of a tambourine, and a trained monkey who read </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">14 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">minds, and the multi-use machine that could be used at the same time to sew on buttons and reduce </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fevers, and the apparatus to make a person forget his bad memories, and a poultice to lose time, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a thousand more inventions so ingenious and unusual that Jose Arcadio Buendia must have wanted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to invent a memory machine so that he could remember them all. In an instant they transformed the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">village. The inhabitants of Macondo found themselves lost is their own streets, confused by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crowded fair. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Holding a child by each hand so as not to lose them in the tumult, bumping into acrobats with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gold-capped teeth and jugglers with six arms, suffocated by the mingled breath of manure and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sandals that the crowd exhaled, Jose Arcadio Buendia went about everywhere like a madman, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looking for Melquiades so that he could reveal to him the infinite secrets of that fabulous nightmare. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He asked several gypsies, who did not understand his language. Finally he reached the place where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades used to set up his tent and he found a taciturn Armenian who in Spanish was hawking a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">syrup to make oneself invisible. He had drunk down a glass of the amber substance in one gulp as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia elbowed his way through the absorbed group that was witnessing the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spectacle, and was able to ask his question. The gypsy wrapped him in the frightful climate of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">look before he turned into a puddle of pestilential and smoking pitch over which the echo of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reply still floated: &ldquo;Melquiades is dead.&rdquo; Upset by the news, Jose Arcadio Buendia stood motionless, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trying to rise above his affliction, until the group dispersed, called away by other artifices, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">puddle of the taciturn Armenian evaporated completely. Other gypsies confirmed later on that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades had in fact succumbed to the fever on the beach at Singapore and that his body had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been thrown into the deepest part of the Java Sea. The children had no interest in the news. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insisted that their father take them to see the overwhelming novelty of the sages of Memphis that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was being advertised at the entrance of a tent that, according to what was said, had belonged to King </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Solomon. They insisted so much that Jose Arcadio Buendia paid the thirty reales and led them into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the center of the tent, where there was a giant with a hairy torso and a shaved head, with a copper </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ring in his nose and a heavy iron chain on his ankle, watching over a pirate chest. When it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opened by the giant, the chest gave off a glacial exhalation. Inside there was only an enormous, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">transparent block with infinite internal needles in which the light of the sunset was broken up into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colored stars. Disconcerted, knowing that the children were waiting for an immediate explanation, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia ventured a murmur: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the largest diamond in the world.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the gypsy countered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ice.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia, without understanding, stretched out his hand toward the cake, but the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">giant moved it away. &ldquo;Five reales more to touch it,&rdquo; he said. Jose Arcadio Buendia paid them and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put his hand on the ice and held it there for several minutes as his heart filled with fear and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">jubilation at the contact with mystery. Without knowing what to say, he paid ten reales more so that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his sons could have that prodigious experience. Little Jose Arcadio refused to touch it. Aureliano, on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the other hand, took a step forward and put his hand on it, withdrawing it immediately. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">boiling,&rdquo; he exclaimed, startled. But his father paid no attention to him. Intoxicated by the evidence </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the miracle, he forgot at that moment about the frustration of his delirious undertakings and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades&rsquo; body, abandoned to the appetite of the squids. He paid another five reales and with his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hand on the cake, as if giving testimony on the holy scriptures, he exclaimed: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is the great invention of our time.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">15 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 2 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">WHEN THE PIRATE Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha in the sixteenth century, Ursula Iguaran&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">great-great-grandmother became so frightened with the ringing of alarm bells and the firing of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cannons that she lost control of her nerves and sat down on a lighted stove. The burns changed her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a useless wife for the rest of her days. She could only sit on one side, cushioned by pillows, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">something strange must have happened to her way of walking, for she never walked again in public. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gave up all kinds of social activity, obsessed with the notion that her body gave off a singed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">odor. Dawn would find her in the courtyard, for she did not dare fall asleep lest she dream of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">English and their ferocious attack dogs as they came through the windows of her bedroom to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">submit her to shameful tortures with their red-hot irons. Her husband, an Aragonese merchant by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whom she had two children, spent half the value of his store on medicines and pastimes in an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attempt to alleviate her terror. Finally he sold the business and took the family to live far from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sea in a settlement of peaceful Indians located in the foothills, where he built his wife a bedroom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without windows so that the pirates of her dream would have no way to get in. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that hidden village there was a native-born tobacco planter who had lived there for some time, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don Jose Arcadio Buendfa, with whom Ursula&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather established a partnership </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was so lucrative that within a few years they made a fortune. Several centuries later the great- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">great-grandson of the native-born planter married the great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, every time that Ursula became exercised over her husband&rsquo;s mad ideas, she would leap </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back over three hundred years of fate and curse the day that Sir Francis Drake had attacked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Riohacha. It was simply a way. of giving herself some relief, because actually they were joined till </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death by a bond that was more solid that love: a common prick of conscience. They were cousins. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had grown up together in the old village that both of their ancestors, with their work and their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">good habits, had transformed into one of the finest towns in the province. Although their marriage </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was predicted from the time they had come into the world, when they expressed their desire to be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">married their own relatives tried to stop it. They were afraid that those two healthy products of two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">races that had interbred over the centuries would suffer the shame of breeding iguanas. There had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">already been a horrible precedent. An aunt of Ursula&rsquo;s, married to an uncle of Jose Arcadio Buendfa, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had a son who went through life wearing loose, baggy trousers and who bled to death after having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lived forty-two years in the purest state of virginity, for he had been born and had grown up with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew and with a small tuft of hair on the tip. A pig&rsquo;s tail that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was never allowed to be seen by any woman and that cost him his life when a butcher friend did him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the favor of chopping it off with his cleaver. Jose Arcadio Buendfa, with the whimsy of his nineteen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">years, resolved the problem with a single phrase: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I have piglets as long as they can </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">talk.&rdquo; So they were married amidst a festival of fireworks and a brass band that went on for three </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days. They would have been happy from then on if Ursula&rsquo;s mother had not terrified her with all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manner of sinister predictions about their offspring, even to the extreme of advising her to refuse to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consummate the marriage. Fearing that her stout and willful husband would rape her while she slept, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula, before going to bed, would put on a rudimentary kind of drawers that her mother had made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out of sailcloth and had reinforced with a system of crisscrossed leather straps and that was closed in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the front by a thick iron buckle. That was how they lived for several months. During the day he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would take care of his fighting cocks and she would do frame embroidery with her mother. At night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they would wrestle for several hours in an anguished violence that seemed to be a substitute for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">act of love, until popular intuition got a whiff of something irregular and the mmor spread that </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">16 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was still a virgin a year after her marriage because her husband was impotent. Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia was the last one to hear the mmor. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look at what people are going around saying, Ursula,&rdquo; he told his wife very calmly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let them talk,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We know that it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the situation went on the same way for another six months until that tragic Sunday when Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia won a cockfight from Prudencio Aguilar. Furious, aroused by the blood of his bird, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the loser backed away from Jose Arcadio Buendia so that everyone in the cockpit could hear what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was going to tell him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife a favor.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia serenely picked up his rooster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; he told everyone. And </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then to Prudencio Aguilar: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You go home and get a weapon, because I&rsquo;m going to kill you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ten minutes later he returned with the notched spear that had belonged to his grandfather. At </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the door to the cockpit, where half the town had gathered, Prudencio Aguilar was waiting for him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no time to defend himself. Jose Arcadio Buendia&rsquo;s spear, thrown with the strength of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bull and with the same good aim with which the first Aureliano Buendia had exterminated the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">jaguars in the region, pierced his throat. That night, as they held a wake over the corpse in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cockpit, Jose Arcadio Buendia went into the bedroom as his wife was putting on her chastity pants. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pointing the spear at her he ordered: &ldquo;Take them off.&rdquo; Ursula had no doubt about her husband&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decision. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be responsible for what happens,&rdquo; she murmured. Jose Arcadio Buendia stuck the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spear into the dirt floor. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you bear iguanas, we&rsquo;ll raise iguanas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;ll be no more killings in this town </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because of you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a fine June night, cool and with a moon, and they were awake and frolicking in bed until </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dawn, indifferent to the breeze that passed through the bedroom, loaded with the weeping of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pmdencio Aguilar&rsquo;s kin. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The matter was put down as a duel of honor, but both of them were left with a twinge in their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conscience. One night, when she could not sleep, Ursula went out into the courtyard to get some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">water and she saw Prudencio Aguilar by the water jar. He was livid, a sad expression on his face, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trying to cover the hole in his throat with a plug made of esparto grass. It did not bring on fear in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her, but pity. She went back to the room and told her husband what she had seen, but he did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">think much of it. &ldquo;This just means that we can&rsquo;t stand the weight of our conscience.&rdquo; Two nights </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">later Ursula saw Prudencio Aguilar again, in the bathroom, using the esparto plug to wash the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clotted blood from his throat. On another night she saw him strolling in the rain. Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia, annoyed by his wife&rsquo;s hallucinations, went out into the courtyard armed with the spear. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was the dead man with his sad expression. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You go to hell,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia shouted at him. &ldquo;Just as many times as you come back, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll kill you again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pmdencio Aguilar did not go away, nor did Jose Arcadio Buendia dare throw the spear. He never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slept well after that. He was tormented by the immense desolation with which the dead man had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looked at him through the rain, his deep nostalgia as he yearned for living people, the anxiety with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which he searched through the house looking for some water with which to soak his esparto plug. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He must be suffering a great deal,&rdquo; he said to Ursula. &ldquo;You can see that he&rsquo;s so very lonely.&rdquo; She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was so moved that the next time she saw the dead man uncovering the pots on the stove she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understood what he was looking for, and from then on she placed water jugs all about the house. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night when he found him washing his wound in his own room, Jose Anedio Buendia could no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">longer resist. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">17 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Prudencio,&rdquo; he told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to leave this town, just as far away as we </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">can go, and we&rsquo;ll never come back. Go in peace now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how they undertook the crossing of the mountains. Several friends of Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia, young men like him, excited, by the adventure, dismantled their houses and packed up, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">along with their wives and children, to head toward the land that no one had promised them. Before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he left, Jose Arcadio Buendia buried the spear in the courtyard and, one after the other, he cut the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">throats of his magnificent fighting cocks, trusting that in that way he could give some measure of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">peace to Pmdencio Aguilar. All that Ursula took along were a trunk with her bridal clothes, a few </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">household utensils, and the small chest with the gold pieces that she had inherited from her father. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They did not lay out any definite itinerary. They simply tried to go in a direction opposite to the road </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to Riohacha so that they would not leave any trace or meet any people they knew. It was an absurd </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">journey. After fourteen months, her stomach corrupted by monkey meat and snake stew, Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave birth to a son who had all of his features human. She had traveled half of the trip in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hammock that two men carried on their shoulders, because swelling had disfigured her legs and her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">varicose veins had puffed up like bubbles. Although it was pitiful to see them with their sunken </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stomachs and languid eyes, the children survived the journey better than their parents, and most of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the time it was fun for them. One morning, after almost two years of crossing, they became the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mortals to see the western slopes of the mountain range. From the cloudy summit they saw the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">immense aquatic expanse of the great swamp as it spread out toward the other side of the world. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they never found the sea. One night, after several months of lost wandering through the swamps, far </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">away now from the last Indians they had met on their way, they camped on the banks of a stony </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">river whose waters were like a torrent of frozen glass. Years later, during the second civil war, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia tried to follow that same route in order to take Riohacha by surprise and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">after six days of traveling he understood that it was madness. Nevertheless, the night on which they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">camped beside the river, his father&rsquo;s host had the look of shipwrecked people with no escape, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their number had grown during the crossing and they were all prepared (and they succeeded) to die </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of old age. Jose Arcadio Buendia dreamed that night that right there a noisy city with houses having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mirror wails rose up. He asked what city it was and they answered him with a name that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">never heard, that had no meaning at all, but that had a supernatural echo in his dream: Macondo. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the following day he convinced his men that they would never find the sea. He ordered them to cut </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down the trees to make a clearing beside the river, at the coolest spot on the bank, and there they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">founded the village. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia did not succeed in deciphering the dream of houses with mirror walls until </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the day he discovered ice. Then he thought he understood its deep meaning. He thought that in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">near future they would be able to manufacture blocks of ice on a large scale from such a common </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">material as water and with them build the new houses of the village. Macondo would no longer be a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burning place, where the hinges and door knockers twisted with the heat, but would be changed into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a wintry city. If he did not persevere in his attempts to build an ice factory, it was because at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time he was absolutely enthusiastic over the education of his sons, especially that of Aureliano, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the first had revealed a strange intuition for alchemy. The laboratory had been dusted off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reviewing Melquiades&rsquo; notes, serene now, without the exaltation of novelty, in prolonged and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patient sessions they tried to separate Ursula&rsquo;s gold from the debris that was stuck to the bottom of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the pot. Young Jose Arcadio scarcely took part in the process. While his father was involved body </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and soul with his water pipe, the willful first-born, who had always been too big for his age, had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">become a monumental adolescent. His voice had changed. An incipient fuzz appeared on his upper </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lip. One night, as Ursula went into the room where he was undressing to go to bed, she felt a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mingled sense of shame and pity: he was the first man that she had seen naked after her husband. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">18 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he was so well-equipped for life that he seemed abnormal. Ursula, pregnant for the third time, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">relived her newlywed terror. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around that time a merry, foul-mouthed, provocative woman came to the house to help with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chorea, and she knew how to read the future in cards. Ursula spoke to her about her son. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought that his disproportionate size was something as unnatural as her cousin&rsquo;s tail of a pig. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman let out an expansive laugh that resounded through the house like a spray of broken </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">glass. &ldquo;Just the opposite,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be very lucky.&rdquo; In order to confirm her prediction she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought her cards to the house a few days later and locked herself up with Jose Arcadio in a granary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off the kitchen. She calmly placed her cards on an old carpenter&rsquo;s bench, saying anything that came </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into her head, while the boy waited beside her, more bored than intrigued. Suddenly she reached out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her hand and touched him. &ldquo;Lordy!&rdquo; she said, sincerely startled, and that was all she could say. Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio felt his bones filling up with foam, a languid fear, and a terrible desire to weep. The woman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made no insinuations. But Jose Arcadio kept looking for her all night long, for the smell of smoke </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she had under her armpits and that had got caught under his skin. He wanted to be with her all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the time, he wanted her to be his mother, for them never to leave the granary, and for her to say </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lordy!&rdquo; to him. One day he could not stand it any more and. he went looking for her at her house: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He made a formal visit, sitting uncomprehendingly in the living room without saying a word. At </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that moment he had no desire for her. He found her different, entirely foreign to the image that her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">smell brought on, as if she were someone else. He drank his coffee and left the house in depression. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night, during the frightful time of lying awake, he desired her again with a brutal anxiety, but he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not want her that time as she had been in the granary but as she had been that afternoon. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Days later the woman suddenly called him to her house, where she was alone with her mother, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she had him come into the bedroom with the pretext of showing him a deck of cards. Then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she touched him with such freedom that he suffered a delusion after the initial shudder, and he felt </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more fear than pleasure. She asked him to come and see her that night. He agreed, in order to get </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">away, knowing that he was incapable of going. But that night, in his burning bed, he understood that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he had to go we her, even if he were not capable. He got dressed by feel, listening in the dark to his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brother&rsquo;s calm breathing, the dry cough of his father in the next room, the asthma of the hens in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard, the buzz of the mosquitoes, the beating of his heart, and the inordinate bustle of a world </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he had not noticed until then, and he went out into the sleeping street. With all his heart he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted the door to be barred and not just closed as she had promised him. But it was open. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pushed it with the tips of his fingers and the hinges yielded with a mournful and articulate moan that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">left a frozen echo inside of him. From the moment he entered, sideways and trying not to make a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">noise, he caught the smell. He was still in the hallway, where the woman&rsquo;s three brothers had their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hammocks in positions that he could not see and that he could not determine in the darkness as he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">felt his way along the hall to push open the bedroom door and get his bearings there so as not to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mistake the bed. He found it. He bumped against the ropes of the hammocks, which were lower </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than he had suspected, and a man who had been snoring until then turned in his sleep and said in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kind of delusion, &ldquo;It was Wednesday.&rdquo; When he pushed open the bedroom door, he could not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor. Suddenly, in the absolute darkness, he understood </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a hopeless nostalgia that he was completely disoriented. Sleeping in the narrow room were the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mother, another daughter with her husband and two children, and the woman, who may not have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been there. He could have guided himself by the smell if the smell had not been all over the house, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so devious and at the same time so definite, as it had always been on his skin. He did not move for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">long time, wondering in fright how he had ever got to that abyss of abandonment, when a hand with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all its fingers extended and feeling about in the darkness touched his face. He was not surprised, for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without knowing, he had been expecting it. Then he gave himself over to that hand, and in a terrible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">state of exhaustion he let himself be led to a shapeless place where his clothes were taken off and he </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">19 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was heaved about like a sack of potatoes and thrown from one side to the other in a bottomless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">darkness in which Inis arms were useless, where it no longer smelled of woman but of ammonia, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where he tried to remember her face and found before him the face of Ursula, confusedly aware that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was doing something that for a very long time he had wanted to do but that he had imagined </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could really never be done, not knowing what he was doing because he did not know where his feet </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were or where Inis head was, or whose feet or whose head, and feeling that he could no longer resist </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the glacial rumbling of his kidneys and the air of his intestines, and fear, and the bewildered anxiety </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to flee and at the same time stay forever in that exasperated silence and that fearful solitude. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her name was Pilar Ternera. She had been part of the exodus that ended with the founding of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo, dragged along by her family in order to separate her from the man who had raped her at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fourteen and had continued to love her until she was twenty-two, but who never made up his mind </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to make the situation public because he was a man apart. He promised to follow her to the ends of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the earth, but only later on, when he put his affairs in order, and she had become tired of waiting for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him, always identifying him with the tall and short, blond and bmnet men that her cards promised </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from land and sea within three days, three months, or three years. With her waiting she had lost the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strength of her thighs, the firmness of her breasts, her habit of tenderness, but she kept the madness </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of her heart intact. Maddened by that prodigious plaything, Jose Arcadio followed her path every </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night through the labyrinth of the room. On a certain occasion he found the door barred, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knocked several times, knowing that if he had the boldness to knock the first time he would have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had to knock until the last, and after an interminable wait she opened the door for him. During the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day, lying down to dream, he would secretly enjoy the memories of the night before. But when she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came into the house, merry, indifferent, chatty, he did not have to make any effort to hide his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tension, because that woman, whose explosive laugh frightened off the doves, had nothing to do </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the invisible power that taught him how to breathe from within and control his heartbeats, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that had permitted him to understand why man are afraid of death. He was so wrapped up in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself that he did not even understand the joy of everyone when his father and his brother aroused </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the household with the news that they had succeeded in penetrating the metallic debris and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">separated Ursula&rsquo;s gold. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had succeeded, as a matter of fact, after putting in complicated and persevering days at it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was happy, and she even gave thanks to God for the invention of alchemy, while the people </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the village cmshed into the laboratory, and they served them guava jelly on crackers to celebrate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the wonder, and Jose Arcadio Buendia let them see the cmcible with the recovered gold, as if he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">just invented it. Showing it all around, he ended up in front of his older son, who during the past </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">few days had barely put in an appearance in the laboratory. He put the dry and yellowish mass in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">front of his eyes and asked him: &ldquo;What does it look like to you?&rdquo; Jose Arcadio answered sincerely: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dog shit.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His father gave him a blow with the back of his hand that brought out blood and tears. That </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night Pilar Ternera put arnica compresses on the swelling, feeling about for the bottle and cotton in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the dark, and she did everything she wanted with him as long as it did not bother him, making an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">effort to love him without hurting him. They reached such a state of intimacy that later, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">realizing it, they were whispering to each other. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to be alone with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;m going to tell everybody and we </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">can stop all of this sneaking around.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did not try to calm him down. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would be fine,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re alone, we&rsquo;ll leave the lamp lighted so that we can see </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">each other, and I can holler as much as I want without anybody&rsquo;s having to butt in, and you can </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whisper in my ear any crap you can think of.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">20 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That conversation, the biting rancor that he felt against his father, and the imminent possibility of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wild love inspired a serene courage in him. In a spontaneous way, without any preparation, he told </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything to his brother. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first young Aureliano understood only the risk, the immense possibility of danger that Iris </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brother&rsquo;s adventures implied, and he could not understand the fascination of the subject. Little by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">little he became contaminated with the anxiety. He wondered about the details of the dangers, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">identified himself with the suffering and enjoyment of his brother, he felt frightened and happy. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would stay awake waiting for him until dawn in the solitary bed that seemed to have a bottom of live </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">coals, and they would keep on talking until it was time to get up, so that both of them soon suffered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the same drowsiness, felt the same lack of interest in alchemy and the wisdom of their father, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and they took refuge in solitude. &ldquo;Those kids are out of their heads,&rdquo; Ursula said. &ldquo;They must have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worms.&rdquo; She prepared a repugnant potion for them made out of mashed wormseed, which they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">both drank with unforeseen stoicism, and they sat down at the same time on their pots eleven times </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in a single day, expelling some rose-colored parasites that they showed to everybody with great </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">jubilation, for it allowed them to deceive Ursula as to the origin of their distractions and drowsiness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano not only understood by then, he also lived his brother&rsquo;s experiences as something of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">own, for on one occasion when the latter was explaining in great detail the mechanism of love, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intermpted him to ask: &ldquo;What does it feel like?&rdquo; Jose Arcadio gave an immediate reply: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an earthquake.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One January Thursday at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Amaranta was born. Before anyone came </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into the room, Ursula examined her carefully. She was light and watery, like a newt, but all of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parts were human: Aureliano did not notice the new thing except when the house became full of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people. Protected by the confusion, he went off in search of his brother, who had not been in bed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since eleven o&rsquo;clock, and it was such an impulsive decision that he did not even have time to ask </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself how he could get him out of Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s bedroom. He circled the house for several </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hours, whistling private calls, until the proximity of dawn forced him to go home. In his mother&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room, playing with the newborn little sister and with a face that drooped with innocence, he found </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was barely over her forty days&rsquo; rest when the gypsies returned. They were the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">acrobats and jugglers that had brought the ice. Unlike Melquiades&rsquo; tribe, they had shown very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">quickly that they were not heralds of progress but purveyors of amusement. Even when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought the ice they did not advertise it for its usefulness in the life of man but as a simple circus </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">curiosity. This time, along with many other artifices, they brought a flying carpet. But they did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">offer it as a fundamental contribution to the development of transport, rather as an object of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recreation. The people at once dug up their last gold pieces to take advantage of a quick flight over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the houses of the village. Protected by the delightful cover of collective disorder, Jose Arcadio and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pilar passed many relaxing hours. They were two happy lovers among the crowd, and they even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came to suspect that love could be a feeling that was more relaxing and deep than the happiness, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wild but momentary, of their secret nights. Pilar, however, broke the spell. Stimulated by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enthusiasm that Jose Arcadio showed in her companionship, she confused the form and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">occasion, and all of a sudden she threw the whole world on top of him. &ldquo;Now you really are a man,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she told him. And since he did not understand what she meant, she spelled it out to him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be a father.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio did not dare leave the house for several days. It was enough for him to hear the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rocking laughter of Pilar in the kitchen to run and take refuge in the laboratory, where the artifacts </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of alchemy had come alive again with Ursula&rsquo;s blessing. Jose Arcadio Buendia received his errant son </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with joy and initiated him in the search for the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which he had finally undertaken. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One afternoon the boys grew enthusiastic over the flying carpet that went swiftly by the laboratory </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">21 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at window level carrying the gypsy who was driving it and several children from the village who were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">merrily waving their hands, but Jose Arcadio Buendia did not even look at it. &ldquo;Let them dream,&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do better flying than they are doing, and with more scientific resources than a miserable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedspread.&rdquo; In spite of his feigned interest, Jose Arcadio must understood the powers of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">philosopher&rsquo;s egg, which to him looked like a poorly blown bottle. He did not succeed in escaping </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from his worries. He lost his appetite and he could not sleep. He fell into an ill humor, the same as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his father&rsquo;s over the failure of his undertakings, and such was his upset that Jose Arcadio Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself relieved him of his duties in the laboratory, thinking that he had taken alchemy too much to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heart. Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother&rsquo;s affliction did not have its source in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">search for the philosopher&rsquo;s stone but he could not get into his confidence. He had lost his former </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spontaneity. From an accomplice and a communicative person he had become withdrawn and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hostile. Anxious for solitude, bitten by a vimlent rancor against the world, one night he left his bed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as usual, but he did not go to Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s house, but to mingle is the tumult of the fair. After </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wandering about among all kinds of contraptions with out becoming interested in any of them, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spotted something that was not a part of it all: a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, who was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weighted down by beads and was the most beautiful woman that Jose Arcadio had ever seen in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">life. She was in the crowd that was witnessing the sad spectacle of the man who had been turned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a snake for having disobeyed his parents. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio paid no attention. While the sad interrogation of the snake-man was taking place, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made his way through the crowd up to the front row, where the gypsy girl was, and he stooped </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">behind her. He pressed against her back. The girl tried to separate herself, but Jose Arcadio pressed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more strongly against her back. Then she felt him. She remained motionless against him, trembling </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with surprise and fear, unable to believe the evidence, and finally she turned her head and looked at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him with a tremulous smile. At that instant two gypsies put the snake-man into his cage and carried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him into the tent. The gypsy who was conducting the show announced: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And now, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to show the terrible test of the woman who must </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have her head chopped off every night at this time for one hundred and fifty years as punishment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for having seen what she should not have.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio and the gypsy girl did not witness the decapitation. They went to her tent, where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they kissed each other with a desperate anxiety while they took off their clothes. The gypsy girl </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">removed the starched lace corsets she had on and there she was, changed into practically nothing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was a languid little frog, with incipient breasts and legs so thin that they did not even match the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">size of Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s arms, but she had a decision and a warmth that compensated for her fragility. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, Jose Arcadio could not respond to her because they were in a kind of public tent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where the gypsies passed through with their circus things and did their business, and would even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tarry by the bed for a game of dice. The lamp hanging from the center pole lighted the whole place </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up. During a pause in the caresses, Jose Arcadio stretched out naked on the bed without knowing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what to do, while the girl tried to inspire him. A gypsy woman with splendid flesh came in a short </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time after accompanied by a man who was not of the caravan but who was not from the village </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">either, and they both began to undress in front of the bed. Without meaning to, the woman looked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at Jose Arcadio and examined his magnificent animal in repose with a kind of pathetic fervor. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;may God preserve you just as you are.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s companion asked them to leave them alone, and the couple lay down on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ground, close to the bed. The passion of the others woke up Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s fervor. On the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contact the bones of the girl seemed to become disjointed with a disorderly cmnch like the sound of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a box of dominoes, and her skin broke out into a pale sweat and her eyes filled with tears as her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whole body exhaled a lugubrious lament and a vague smell of mud. But she bore the impact with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">firmness of character and a bravery that were admirable. Jose Arcadio felt himself lifted up into the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">22 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">air toward a state of seraphic inspiration, where his heart burst forth with an outpouring of tender </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">obscenities that entered the girl through her ears and came out of her mouth translated into her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">language. It was Thursday. On Saturday night, Jose Arcadio wrapped a red cloth around his head </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and left with the gypsies. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Ursula discovered his absence she searched for him all through the village. In the remains </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the gypsy camp there was nothing but a garbage pit among the still smoking ashes of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">extinguished campfires. Someone who was there looking for beads among the trash told Ursula that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the night before he had seen her son in the tumult of the caravan pushing the snake-man&rsquo;s cage on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s become a gypsy&rdquo; she shouted to her husband, who had not shown the slightest sign of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">alarm over the disappearance. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia said, grinding in his mortar the material that had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ground a thousand times and reheated and ground again. &ldquo;That way he&rsquo;ll learn to be a man.&rdquo; Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked where the gypsies had gone. She went along asking and following the road she had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shown, thinking that she still had time to catch up to them. She kept getting farther away from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">village until she felt so far away that she did not think about returning. Jose Arcadio Buendia did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discover that his wife was missing until eight o&rsquo;clock at night, when he left the material warming in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bed of manure and went to see what was wrong with little Amaranta, who was getting hoarse from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crying. In a few hours he gathered a group of well-equipped men, put Amaranta in the hands of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman who offered to nurse her, and was lost on invisible paths in pursuit of Ursula. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went with them. Some Indian fishermen, whose language they could not understand, told them with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">signs that they had not seen anyone pass. After three days of useless searching they returned to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">village. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For several weeks Jose Arcadio Buendia let himself be overcome by consternation. He took care </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of little Amaranta like a mother. He bathed and dressed her, took her to be nursed four times a day, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and even sang to her at night the songs that Ursula never knew how to sing. On a certain occasion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pilar Ternera volunteered to do the household chores until Ursula came back. Aureliano, whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mysterious intuition had become sharpened with the misfortune, felt a glow of clairvoyance when he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saw her come in. Then he knew that in some inexplicable way she was to blame for his brother&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flight and the consequent disappearance of his mother, and he harassed her with a silent and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">implacable hostility in such a way that the woman did not return to the house. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time put things in their place. Jose Arcadio Buendia and his son did not know exactly when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returned to the laboratory, dusting things, lighting the water pipe, involved once more in the patient </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manipulation of the material that had been sleeping for several months in its bed of manure. Even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta, lying in a wicker basket, observed with curiosity the absorbing work of her father and her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brother in the small room where the air was rarefied by mercury vapors. On a certain occasion, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months after Ursula&rsquo;s departure, strange things began to happen. An empty flask that had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forgotten in a cupboard for a long time became so heavy that it could not be moved. A pan of water </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the worktable boiled without any fire under it for a half hour until it completely evaporated. Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia and his son observed those phenomena with startled excitement, unable to explain </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them but interpreting them as predictions of the material. One day Amaranta&rsquo;s basket began to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">move by itself and made a complete turn about the room, to the consternation of Auerliano, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hurried to stop it. But his father did not get upset. He put the basket in its place and tied it to the leg </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a table, convinced that the long-awaited event was imminent. It was on that occasion that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Auerliano heard him say: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t fear God, fear him through the metals. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, almost five months after her disappearance, Ursula came back. She arrived exalted, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rejuvenated, with new clothes in a style that was unknown in the village. Jose Arcadio Buendia could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barely stand up under the impact. &ldquo;That was it!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I knew it was going to happen.&rdquo; And </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">23 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he really believed it, for during his prolonged imprisonment as he manipulated the material, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">begged in the depth of his heart that the longed-for miracle should not be the discovery of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">philosopher&rsquo;s stone, or the freeing of the breath that makes metals live, or the faculty to convert the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hinges and the locks of the house into gold, but what had just happened: Ursula&rsquo;s return. But she did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not share his excitement. She gave him a conventional kiss, as if she had been away only an hour, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she told him: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look out the door.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia took a long time to get out of his perplexity when he went out into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">street and saw the crowd. They were not gypsies. They were men and women like them, with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">straight hair and dark skin, who spoke the same language and complained of the same pains. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had mules loaded down with things to eat, oxcarts with furniture and domestic utensils, pure and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">simple earthly accessories put on sale without any fuss by peddlers of everyday reality. They came </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the other side of the swamp, only two days away, where there were towns that received mail </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">every month in the year and where they were familiar with the implements of good living. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not caught up with the gypsies, but she had found the route that her husband had been unable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to discover in his frustrated search for the great inventions. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">24 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 3 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PILAR TERNERA&rsquo;S son was brought to his grand parents&rsquo; house two weeks after he was born. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">admitted him gmdgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband, who could not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tolerate the idea that an offshoot of his blood should be adrift, but he imposed the condition that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the child should never know his true identity. Although he was given the name Jose Arcadio, they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to avoid confusion. At that time there was so much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">activity in the town and so much bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secondary level. They were put in the care of Visitacion, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">town with a brother in flight from a plague of insomnia that had been scourging their tribe for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">several years. They were both so docile and willing to help that Ursula took them on to help her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta came to speak the Guajiro </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">language before Spanish, and they learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Ursula&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals. Macondo had changed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people who had come with Ursula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">privileged position with respect to the swamp, so that from the narrow village of past times it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which the first Arabs arrived with their baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">macaws. Jose Arcadio Buendia did not have a moment&rsquo;s rest. Fascinated by an immediate reality that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came to be more fantastic than the vast universe of his imagination, he lost all interest in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">alchemist&rsquo;s laboratory, put to rest the material that had become attenuated with months of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manipulation, and went back to being the enterprising man of earlier days when he had decided </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjoy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">privileges that everyone did not have. He acquired such authority among the new arrivals that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foundations were not laid or walls built without his being consulted, and it was decided that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">should be the one in charge of the distribution of the land. When the acrobat gypsies returned, with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their vagabond carnival transformed now into a gigantic organization of games of luck and chance, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they were received with great joy, for it was thought that Jose Arcadio would be coming back with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them. But Jose Arcadio did not return, nor did they come with the snake-man, who, according to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what Ursula thought, was the only one who could tell them about their son, so the gypsies were not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future, for they were considered the bearers of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concupiscence and perversion. Jose Arcadio Buendia, however, was explicit in maintaining that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">old tribe of Melquiades, who had contributed so much to the growth of the village with his age-old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wisdom and his fabulous inventions, would always find the gates open. But Melquiades&rsquo; tribe, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">according to what the wanderers said, had been wiped off the face of the earth because they had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gone beyond the limits of human knowledge. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emancipated for the moment at least from the torment of fantasy, Jose Arcadio Buendia in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">short time set up a system of order and work which allowed for only one bit of license: the freeing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the birds, which, since the time of the founding, had made time merry with their flutes, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">installing in their place musical clocks in every house. They were wondrous clocks made of carved </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and which Jose Arcadio Buendia had synchronized </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with such precision that every half hour the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same song until it reached the climax of a noontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waltz. It was also Jose Arcadio Buendia who decided during those years that they should plant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">almond trees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to make them live forever. Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">25 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still stood on the oldest streets, although no one knew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who had planted them. While his father was putting the town in order and Inis mother was increasing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their wealth with her marvelous business of candied little roosters and fish, which left the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twice a day strung along sticks of balsa wood, Aureliano spent interminable hours in the abandoned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laboratory, learning the art of silverwork by his own experimentation. He had shot up so fast that in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a short time the clothing left behind by his brother no longer fit him and he began to wear his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">father&rsquo;s, but Visitacion had to sew pleats in the shirt and darts in the pants, because Aureliano had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not sequined the corpulence of the others. Adolescence had taken away the softness of his voice and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had made him silent and definitely solitary, but, on the other hand, it had restored the intense </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression that he had had in his eyes when he was born. He concentrated so much on his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">experiments in silverwork that he scarcely left the laboratory to eat. Worried ever his inner </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">withdrawal, Jose Arcadio Buendia gave him the keys to the house and a little money, thinking that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepare some aqua </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">regia and he beautified the keys by plating them with gold. His excesses were hardly comparable to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about all day clutching at the Indians&rsquo; cloaks, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guajiro language. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t complain.&rdquo; Ursula told her husband. &ldquo;Children inherit their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parents&rsquo; madness.&rdquo; And as she was lamenting her misfortune, convinced that the wild behavior of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her children was something as fearful as a pig&rsquo;s tail, Aureliano gave her a look that wrapped her in an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">atmosphere of uncertainty. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Somebody is coming,&rdquo; he told her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula, as she did whenever he made a prediction, tried to break it down with her housewifely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">logic. It was normal for someone to be coming. Dozens of strangers came through Macondo every </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day without arousing suspicion or secret ideas. Nevertheless, beyond all logic, Aureliano was sure of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Iris prediction. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who it will be,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;but whoever it is is already on the way.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was only eleven years old. She had made the difficult </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trip from Manaure with some hide dealers who had taken on the task of delivering her along with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letter to Jose Arcadio Buendia, but they could not explain precisely who the person was who had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked the favor. Her entire baggage consisted of a small trunk, a little rocking chair with small hand- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">painted flowers, and a canvas sack which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, where she carried her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parents&rsquo; bones. The letter addressed to Jose Arcadio Buendia was written is very warm terms by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">someone who still loved him very much in spite of time and distance, and who felt obliged by a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send him that poor unsheltered orphan, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who was a second cousin of Ursula&rsquo;s and consequendy also a relative of Jose Arcadio Buendia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">although farther removed, because she was the daughter of that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may God keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the girl was carrying so that they might be given Christian burial. The names mentioned, as well as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the signature on the letter, were perfecdy legible, but neither Jose Arcadio, Buendia nor Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remembered having any relatives with those names, nor did they know anyone by the name of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sender of the letter, much less the remote village of Manaure. It was impossible to obtain any further </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">information from the girl. From the moment she arrived she had been sitting in the rocker, sucking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her finger and observing everyone with her large, startled eyes without giving any sign of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understanding what they were asking her. She wore a diagonally striped dress that had been dyed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">black, worn by use, and a pair of scaly patent leather boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bows of black ribbon. She wore a scapular with the images worn away by sweat, and on her right </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrist the fang of a carnivorous animal mounted on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eye. Her greenish skin, her stomach, round and tense as a drum, revealed poor health and hunger </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">26 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that were older than she was, but when they gave her something to eat she kept the plate on her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knees without tasting anything. They even began to think that she was a deaf-mute until the Indians </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them and said yes with her head. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They kept her, because there was nothing else they could do. They decided to call her Rebeca, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which according to the letter was her mother&rsquo;s name, because Aureliano had the patience to read to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her the names of all the saints and he did not get a reaction from any one of them. Since there was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no cemetery in Macondo at that time, for no one had died up till then, they kept the bag of bones to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wait for a worthy place of burial, and for a long time it got in the way everywhere and would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found where least expected, always with its clucking of a broody hen. A long time passed before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca became incorporated into the life of the family. She would sit in her small rocker sucking her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finger in the most remote corner of the house. Nothing attracted her attention except the music of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the clocks, which she would look for every half hour with her frightened eyes as if she hoped to find </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it someplace in the air. They could not get her to eat for several days. No one understood why she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not died of hunger until the Indians, who were aware of everything, for they went ceaselessly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about the house on their stealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the damp earth of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard and the cake of whitewash that she picked of the walls with her nails. It was obvious that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolded her for that habit because she did it secretively </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and with a feeling of guilt, trying to put away supplies so that she could eat when no one was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looking. From then on they put her under an implacable watch. They threw cow gall onto the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard and, mbbed hot chili on the walls, thinking they could defeat her pernicious vice with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those methods, but she showed such signs of astuteness and ingenuity to find some earth that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula found herself forced to use more drastic methods. She put some orange juice and rhubarb </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a pan that she left in the dew all night and she gave her the dose the following day on an empty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stomach. Although no one had told her that it was the specific remedy for the vice of eating earth, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she thought that any bitter substance in an empty stomach would have to make the liver react. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her frailness that they had to tie her up like a calf to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">make her swallow the medicine, and they could barely keep back her kicks or bear up under the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strange hieroglyphics that she alternated with her bites and spitting, and that, according to what the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scandalized Indians said, were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their language. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Ursula discovered that, she added whipping to the treatment. It was never established </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whether it was the rhubarb or the beatings that had effect, or both of them together, but the truth </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was that in a few weeks Rebeca began to show signs of recovery. She took part in the games of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio and Amaranta, who treated her like an older sister, and she ate heartily, using the utensils </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">properly. It was soon revealed that she spoke Spanish with as much fluency as the Indian language, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she had a remarkable ability for manual work, and that she could sing the waltz of the clocks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with some very funny words that she herself had invented. It did not take long for them to consider </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her another member of the family. She was more affectionate to Ursula than any of her own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children had been, and she called Arcadio, and Amaranta brother and sister, Aureliano uncle, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia grandpa. So that she finally deserved, as much as the others, the name of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca Buendia, the only one that she ever had and that she bore with dignity until her death. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night about the time that Rebeca was cured of the vice of eating earth and was brought to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sleep in the other children&rsquo;s room, the Indian woman, who slept with them awoke by chance and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heard a strange, intermittent sound in the corner. She got up in alarm, thinking that an animal had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come into the room, and then she saw Rebeca in the rocker, sucking her finger and with her eyes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lighted up in the darkness like those of a cat. Terrified, exhausted by her fate, Visitacion recognized </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in those eyes the symptoms of the sickness whose threat had obliged her and her brother to exile </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">27 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">themselves forever from an age-old kingdom where they had been prince and princess. It was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insomnia plague. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cataure, the Indian, was gone from the house by morning. His sister stayed because her fatalistic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heart told her that the lethal sickness would follow her, no matter what, to the farthest corner of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">earth. No one understood Visitacion&rsquo;s alarm. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t ever sleep again, so much the better,&rdquo; Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia said in good humor. &ldquo;That way we can get more out of life.&rdquo; But the Indian </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman explained that the most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the impossibility </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of sleeping, for the body did not feel any fatigue at all, but its inexorable evolution toward a more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">critical manifestation: a loss of memory. She meant that when the sick person became used to his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">state of vigil, the recollection of his childhood began to be erased from his memory, then the name </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and notion of tilings, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of his own being, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">until he sank into a kind of idiocy that had no past. Jose Arcadio Buendia, dying with laughter, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought that it was just a question of one of the many illnesses invented by the Indians&rsquo; supersti&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tions. But Ursula, just to be safe, took the precaution of isolating Rebeca from the other children. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After several weeks, when Visitacion&rsquo;s terror seemed to have died down, Jose Arcadio Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found himself rolling over in bed, unable to fall asleep. Ursula, who had also awakened, asked him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what was wrong, and he answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about Pmdencio Aguilar again.&rdquo; They did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sleep a minute, but the following day they felt so rested that they forgot about the bad night. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano commented with surprise at lunchtime that he felt very well in spite of the fact that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spent the whole night in the laboratory gilding a brooch that he planned to give to Ursula for her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">birthday. They did not become alarmed until the third day, when no one felt sleepy at bedtime and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they realized that they had gone more than fifty hours without sleeping. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The children are awake too,&rdquo; the Indian said with her fatalistic conviction. &ldquo;Once it gets into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house no one can escape the plague.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had indeed contracted the illness of insomnia. Ursula, who had learned from her mother </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the medicinal value of plants, prepared and made them all drink a brew of monkshood, but they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could not get to sleep and spent the whole day dreaming on their feet. In that state of hallucinated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lucidity, not only did they see the images of their own dreams, but some saw the images dreamed by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">others. It was as if the house were full of visitors. Sitting in her rocker in a corner of the kitchen, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca dreamed that a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linen and with his shirt </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">collar closed by a gold button, was bringing her a bouquet of roses. He was accompanied by a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman with delicate hands who took out one rose and put it in the child&rsquo;s hair. Ursula understood </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the man and woman were Rebeca&rsquo;s parents, but even though she made a great effort to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recognize them, she confirmed her certainty that she had never seen them. In the meantime, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through an oversight that Jose Arcadio Buendia never forgave himself for, the candy animals made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the house were still being sold in the town. Children and adults sucked with delight on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">delicious little green roosters of insomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ponies of insomnia, so that dawn on Monday found the whole town awake. No one was alarmed at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first. On the contrary, they were happy at not sleeping because there was so much to do in Macondo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in those days that there was barely enough time. They worked so hard that soon they had nothing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">else to do and they could be found at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning with their arms crossed, counting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the notes in the waltz of the clock. Those who wanted to sleep, not from fatigue but because of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nostalgia for dreams, tried all kinds of methods of exhausting themselves. They would gather </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">together to converse endlessly, to tell over and over for hours on end the same jokes, to complicate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the limits of exasperation the story about the capon, which was an endless game in which the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">narrator asked if they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">yes, the narrator would say that he had not asked them to say yes, but whether they wanted him to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered no, the narrator told them that he had </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">28 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not asked them to say no, but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when they remained silent the narrator told them that he had not asked them to remain silent but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and no one could leave because the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">narrator would say that he had not asked them to leave but whether they wanted him to tell them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the story about the capon, and so on and on in a vicious circle that lasted entire nights. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Jose Arcadio Buendia realized that the plague had invaded the town, he gathered together </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the heads of families to explain to them what he knew about the sickness of insomnia, and they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">agreed on methods to prevent the scourge from spreading to other towns in the swamp. That was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">why they took the bells off the goats, bells that the Arabs had swapped them for macaws, and put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them at the entrance to town at the disposal of those who would not listen to the advice and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">entreaties of the sentinels and insisted on visiting the town. All strangers who passed through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">streets of Macondo at that time had to ring their bells so that the sick people would know that they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were healthy. They were not allowed to eat or drink anything during their stay, for there was no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doubt but that the illness was transmitted by mouth, and all food and drink had been contaminated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by insomnia. In that way they kept the plague restricted to the perimeter of the town. So effective </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was the quarantine that the day came when the emergency situation was accepted as a natural thing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and life was organized in such a way that work picked up its rhythm again and no one worried any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more about the useless habit of sleeping. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Aureliano who conceived the formula that was to protect them against loss of memory for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">several months. He discovered it by chance. An expert insomniac, having been one of the first, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had learned the art of silverwork to perfection. One day he was looking for the small anvil that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">used for laminating metals and he could not remember its name. His father told him: &ldquo;Stake.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano wrote the name on a piece of paper that he pasted to the base of the small anvil: stake. In </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that way he was sure of not forgetting it in the future. It did not occur to him that this was the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manifestation of a loss of memory, because the object had a difficult name to remember. But a few </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days later be, discovered that he had trouble remembering almost every object in the laboratory. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he marked them with their respective names so that all he had to do was read the inscription </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in order to identify them. When his father told him about his alarm at having forgotten even the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">most impressive happenings of his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia put it into practice all through the house and later on imposed it on the whole </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">village. With an inked brush he marked everything with its name: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, pan. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He went to the corral and marked the animals and plants: cow, goat, pig, hen, cassava, caladium, banana. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Little by little, studying the infinite possibilities of a loss of memory, he realized that the day might </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come when tilings would be recognized by their inscriptions but that no one would remember their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">use. Then he was more explicit. The sign that he hung on the neck of the cow was an exemplary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proof of the way in which the inhabitants of Macondo were prepared to fight against loss of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memory: This is the cow. She must be milked every morning so that she will produce milk, and the milk must be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">boiled in order to be mixed with coffee to make coffee and milk. Thus they went on living in a reality that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slipping away, momentarily captured by words, but which would escape irremediably when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forgot the values of the written letters. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the beginning of the road into the swamp they put up a sign that said MACONDO and another </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">larger one on the main street that said GOD EXISTS. In all the houses keys to memorizing objects </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and feelings had been written. But the system demanded so much vigilance and moral strength that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many succumbed to the spell of an imaginary reality, one invented by themselves, which was less </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">practical for them but more comforting. Pilar Ternera was the one who contributed most to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">popularize that mystification when she conceived the trick of reading the past in cards as she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">read the future before. By means of that recourse the insomniacs began to live in a world built on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the uncertain alternatives of the cards, where a father was remembered faintly as the dark man who </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">29 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had arrived at the beginning of April and a mother was remembered only as the dark woman who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wore a gold ring on her left hand, and where a birth date was reduced to the last Tuesday on which a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lark sang in the laurel tree. Defeated by those practices of consolation, Jose Arcadio Buendia then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decided to build the memory machine that he had desired once in order to remember the marvelous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inventions of the gypsies. The artifact was based on the possibility of reviewing every morning, from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beginning to end, the totality of knowledge acquired during one&rsquo;s life. He conceived of it as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spinning dictionary that a person placed on the axis could operate by means of a lever, so that in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very few hours there would pass before his eyes the notions most necessary for life. He had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">succeeded in writing almost fourteen thousand entries when along the road from the swamp a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strange-looking old man with the sad sleepers&rsquo; bell appeared, carrying a bulging suitcase tied with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rope and pulling a cart covered with black cloth. He went straight to the house of Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Visitacion did not recognize him when she opened the door and she thought he had come with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the idea of selling something, unaware that nothing could be sold in a town that was sinking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">irrevocably into the quicksand of forgetfulness. He was a decrepit man. Although his voice was also </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">broken by uncertainty and his hands seemed to doubt the existence of things, it was evident that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came from the world where men could still sleep and remember. Jose Arcadio Buendia found him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sitting in the living room fanning himself with a patched black hat as he read with compassionate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention the signs pasted to the walls. He greeted him with a broad show of affection, afraid that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had known him at another time and that he did not remember him now. But the visitor was aware </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his falseness. He felt himself forgotten, not with the irremediable forgetfulness of the heart, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a different kind of forgetfulness, which was more cmel and irrevocable and which he knew very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">well because it was the forgetfulness of death. Then he understood. He opened the suitcase </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crammed with indecipherable objects and from among then he took out a little case with many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flasks. He gave Jose Arcadio Buendia a drink of a gentle color and the light went on in his memory. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes became moist from weeping even before he noticed himself in an absurd living room </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where objects were labeled and before he was ashamed of the solemn nonsense written on the walls, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and even before he recognized the newcomer with a dazzling glow of joy. It was Melquiades. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, Jose Arcadio Buendia and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades dusted off their old friendship. The gypsy was inclined to stay in the town. He really had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude. Repudiated by his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tribe, having lost all of his supernatural faculties because of his faithfulness to life, he decided to take </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">refuge in that corner of the world which had still not been discovered by death, dedicated to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">operation of a daguerreotype laboratory. Jose Arcadio Buendia had never heard of that invention. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when he saw himself and his whole family fastened onto a sheet of iridescent metal for an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eternity, he was mute with stupefaction. That was the date of the oxidized daguerreotype in which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia appeared with his brisdy and graying hair, his card board collar attached to his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shirt by a copper button, and an expression of startled solemnity, whom Ursula described, dying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with laughter, as a &ldquo;frightened general.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia was, in fact, frightened on that dear </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">December morning when the daguerreotype was made, for he was thinking that people were slowly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wearing away while his image would endure an a metallic plaque. Through a curious reversal of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">custom, it was Ursula who got that idea out of his head, as it was also she who forgot her ancient </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bitterness and decided that Melquiades would stay on in the house, although she never permitted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them to make a daguerreotype of her because (according to her very words) she did not want to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">survive as a laughingstock for her grandchildren. That morning she dressed the children in their best </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clothes, powdered their faces, and gave a spoonful of marrow syrup to each one so that they would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all remain absolutely motionless during the nearly two minutes in front of Melquiades fantastic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">camera. In the family daguerreotype, the only one that ever existed, Aureliano appeared dressed in </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">30 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">black velvet between Amaranta and Rebeca. He had the same languor and the same clairvoyant look </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he would have years later as he faced the firing squad. But he still had not sensed the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">premonition of his fate. He was an expert silversmith, praised all over the swampland for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">delicacy of his work. In the workshop, which he shared with Melquiades&rsquo; mad laboratory, he could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barely be heard breathing. He seemed to be taking refuge in some other time, while his father and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the gypsy with shouts interpreted the predictions of Nostradamus amidst a noise of flasks and trays </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the disaster of spilled acids and silver bromide that was lost in the twists and turns it gave at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">every instant. That dedication to his work, the good judgment with which he directed his attention, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had allowed Aureliano to earn in a short time more money than Ursula had with her delicious candy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fauna, but everybody thought it strange that he was now a full-grown man and had not known a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman. It was true that he had never had one. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Several months later saw the return of Francisco the Man, as ancient vagabond who was almost </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two hundred years old and who frequently passed through Macondo distributing songs that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">composed himself. In them Francisco the Man told in great detail the things that had happened in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the towns along his route, from Manaure to the edge of the swamp, so that if anyone had a message </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to send or an event to make public, he would pay him two cents to include it in his repertory. That </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was how Ursula learned of the death of her mother, as a simple consequence of listening to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">songs in the hope that they would say something about her son Jose Arcadio. Francisco the Man, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">called that because he had once defeated the devil in a duel of improvisation, and whose real name </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no one knew, disappeared from Macondo during the insomnia plague and one night he appeared </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suddenly in Catarino&rsquo;s store. The whole town went to listen to him to find out what had happened </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the world. On that occasion there arrived with him a woman who was so fat that four Indians had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to carry her in a rocking chair, and an adolescent mulatto girl with a forlorn look who protected her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the sun with an umbrella. Aureliano went to Catarino&rsquo;s store that night. He found Francisco </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Man, like a monolithic chameleon, sitting in the midst of a circle of bystanders. He was singing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the news with his old, out-of-tune voice, accompanying himself with the same archaic accordion that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in the Guianas and keeping time with his great walking feet that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were cracked from saltpeter. In front of a door at the rear through which men were going and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">coming, the matron of the rocking chair was sitting and fanning herself in silence. Catarino, with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">felt rose behind his ear, was selling the gathering mugs of fermented cane juice, and he took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">advantage of the occasion to go over to the men and put his hand on them where he should not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have. Toward midnight the heat was unbearable. Aureliano listened to the news to the end without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hearing anything that was of interest to his family. He was getting ready to go home when the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">matron signaled him with her hand. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You go in too.&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;It only costs twenty cents.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano threw a coin into the hopper that the matron had in her lap and went into the room </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without knowing why. The adolescent mulatto girl, with her small bitch&rsquo;s teats, was naked on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bed. Before Aureliano sixty-three men had passed through the room that night. From being used so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much, kneaded with sweat and sighs, the air in the room had begun to turn to mud. The girl took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off the soaked sheet and asked Aureliano to hold it by one side. It was as heavy as a piece of canvas. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They squeezed it, twisting it at the ends until it regained its natural weight. They turned over the mat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the sweat came out of the other side. Aureliano was anxious for that operation never to end. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew the theoretical mechanics of love, but he could not stay on his feet because of the weakness of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his knees, and although he had goose pimples on his burning skin he could not resist the urgent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">need to expel the weight of his bowels. When the girl finished fixing up the bed and told him to get </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">undressed, he gave her a confused explanation: &ldquo;They made me come in. They told me to throw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twenty cents into the hopper and hurry up.&rdquo; The girl understood his confusion. &ldquo;If you throw in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twenty cents more when you go out, you can stay a little longer,&rdquo; she said softly. Aureliano got </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">31 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">undressed, tormented by shame, unable to get rid of the idea that-his nakedness could not stand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">comparison with that of his brother. In spite of the girl&rsquo;s efforts he felt more and more indifferent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and terribly alone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw in other twenty cents,&rdquo; he said with a desolate voice. The girl thanked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him in silence. Her back was raw. Her skin was stuck to her ribs and her breathing was forced </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because of an immeasurable exhaustion. Two years before, far away from there, she had fallen asleep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without putting out the candle and had awakened surrounded by flames. The house where she lived </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the grandmother who had raised her was reduced to ashes. Since then her grandmother carried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her from town to town, putting her to bed for twenty cents in order to make up the value of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burned house. According to the girl&rsquo;s calculations, she still had ten years of seventy men per night, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because she also had to pay the expenses of the trip and food for both of them as well as the pay of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Indians who carried the rocking chair. When the matron knocked on the door the second time, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano left the room without having done anything, troubled by a desire to weep. That night he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could not sleep, thinking about the girl, with a mixture of desire and pity. He felt an irresistible need </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to love her and protect her. At dawn, worn out by insomnia and fever, he made the calm decision to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marry her in order to free her from the despotism of her grandmother and to enjoy all the nights of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">satisfaction that she would give the seventy men. But at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when he reached </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Catarino&rsquo;s store, the girl had left town. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time mitigated his mad proposal, but it aggravated his feelings of frustration. He took refuge in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">work. He resigned himself to being a womanless man for all his life in order to hide the shame of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">uselessness. In the meantime, Melquiades had printed on his plates everything that was printable in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo, and he left the daguerreotype laboratory to the fantasies of Jose Arcadio Buendia who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had resolved to use it to obtain scientific proof of the existence of God. Through a complicated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">process of superimposed exposures taken in different parts of the house, he was sure that sooner or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">later he would get a daguerreotype of God, if He existed, or put an end once and for all to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">supposition of His existence. Melquiades got deeper into his interpretations of Nostradamus. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would stay up until very late, suffocating in his faded velvet vest, scribbling with his tiny sparrow </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hands, whose rings had lost the glow of former times. One night he thought he had found a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prediction of the future of Macondo. It was to be a luminous city with great glass houses where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there was no trace remaining of the race of the Buendia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thundered. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be houses of glass but of ice, as I dreamed, and there will always be a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia, per omnia secula seculorumP Ursula fought to preserve common sense in that extravagant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house, having broadened her business of little candy animals with an oven that went all night turning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out baskets and more baskets of bread and a prodigious variety of puddings, meringues, and cookies, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which disappeared in a few hours on the roads winding through the swamp. She had reached an age </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where she had a right to rest, but she was nonetheless more and more active. So busy was she in her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prosperous enterprises that one afternoon she looked distractedly toward the courtyard while the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indian woman helped her sweeten the dough and she saw two unknown and beautiful adolescent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">girls doing frame embroidery in the light of the sunset. They were Rebeca and Amaranta. As soon as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had taken off the mourning clothes for their grandmother, which they wore with inflexible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rigor for three years, their bright clothes seemed to have given them a new place in the world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca, contrary to what might have been expected, was the more beautiful. She had a light </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complexion, large and peaceful eyes, and magical hands that seemed to work out the design of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">embroidery with invisible threads. Amaranta, the younger, was somewhat graceless, but she had the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">natural distinction, the inner tightness of her dead grandmother. Next to them, although he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">already revealing the physical drive of his father, Arcadio looked like a child. He set about learning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the art of silverwork with Aureliano, who had also taught him how to read and write. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suddenly realized that the house had become full of people, that her children were on the point of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marrying and having children, and that they would be obliged to scatter for lack of space. Then she </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">32 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took out the money she had accumulated over long years of hard labor, made some arrangements </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with her customers, and undertook the enlargement of the house. She had a formal parlor for visits </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">built, another one that was more comfortable and cool for daily use, a dining room with a table with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twelve places where the family could sit with all of their guests, nine bedrooms with windows on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard and a long porch protected from the heat of noon by a rose garden with a railing on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which to place pots of ferns and begonias. She had the kitchen enlarged to hold two ovens. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">granary where Pilar Ternera had read Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s future was tom down and another twice as large </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">built so that there would never be a lack of food in the house. She had baths built is the courtyard in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the shade of the chestnut tree, one for the women and another for the men, and in the rear a large </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stable, a fenced-in chicken yard, a shed for the milk cows, and an aviary open to the four winds so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that wandering birds could roost there at their pleasure. Followed by dozens of masons and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carpenters, as if she had contracted her husband&rsquo;s hallucinating fever, Ursula fixed the position of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">light and heat and distributed space without the least sense of its limitations. The primitive building </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the founders became filled with tools and materials, of workmen exhausted by sweat, who asked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everybody please not to molest them, exasperated by the sack of bones that followed them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everywhere with its dull rattle. In that discomfort, breathing quicklime and tar, no one could see very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">well how from the bowels of the earth there was rising not only the largest house is the town, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the most hospitable and cool house that had ever existed in the region of the swamp. Jose Buendia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trying to surprise Divine Providence in the midst of the cataclysm, was the one who least </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understood it. The new house was almost finished when Ursula drew him out of his chimerical </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">world in order to inform him that she had an order to paint the front blue and not white as they had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted. She showed him the official document. Jose Arcadio Buendia, without understanding what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his wife was talking about, deciphered the signature. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who is this fellow?&rdquo; he asked: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The magistrate,&rdquo; Ursula answered disconsolately. They say he&rsquo;s an authority sent by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">government.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don Apolinar Moscote, the magistrate, had arrived in Macondo very quietly. He put up at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hotel Jacob&mdash;built by one of the first Arabs who came to swap knickknacks for macaws&mdash;and on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the following day he rented a small room with a door on the street two blocks away from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia house. He set up a table and a chair that he had bought from Jacob, nailed up on the wall </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the shield of the republic that he had brought with him, and on the door he painted the sign: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magistrate. His first order was for all the houses to be painted blue in celebration of the anniversary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of national independence. Jose Arcadio Buendia, with the copy of the order in his hand, found him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taking his nap in a hammock he had set up in the narrow office. &ldquo;Did you write this paper?&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked him. Don Apolinar Moscote, a mature man, timid, with a ruddy complexion, said yes. &ldquo;By </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what right?&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia asked again. Don Apolinar Moscote picked up a paper from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drawer of the table and showed it to him. &ldquo;I have been named magistrate of this town.&rdquo; Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia did not even look at the appointment. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In this town we do not give orders with pieces of paper,&rdquo; he said without losing his calm. &ldquo;And </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so that you know it once and for all, we don&rsquo;t need any judge here because there&rsquo;s nothing that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">needs judging.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Facing Don Apolinar Moscote, still without raising his voice, he gave a detailed account of how </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had founded the village, of how they had distributed the land, opened the roads, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">introduced the improvements that necessity required without having bothered the government and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without anyone having bothered them. &ldquo;We are so peaceful that none of us has died even of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">natural death,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can see that we still don&rsquo;t have any cemetery.&rdquo; No once was upset that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the government had not helped them. On the contrary, they were happy that up until then it had let </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them grow in peace, and he hoped that it would continue leaving them that way, because they had </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">33 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not founded a town so that the first upstart who came along would tell them what to do. Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apolinar had put on his denim jacket, white like his trousers, without losing at any moment the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">elegance of his gestures. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that if you want to stay here like any other ordinary citizen, you&rsquo;re quite welcome,&rdquo; Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendla concluded. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ve come to cause disorder by making the people paint their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">houses blue, you can pick up your junk and go back where you came from. Because my house is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">going to be white, white, like a dove.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don Apolinar Moscote turned pale. He took a step backward and tightened his jaws as he said </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a certain affliction: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I must warn you that I&rsquo;m armed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendla did not know exactly when his hands regained the useful strength with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which he used to pull down horses. He grabbed Don Apolinar Moscote by the lapels and lifted him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up to the level of his eyes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I would rather carry you around alive and not have to keep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carrying you around dead for the rest of my life.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that way he carried him through the middle of the street, suspended by the lapels, until he put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him down on his two feet on the swamp road. A week later he was back with six barefoot and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ragged soldiers, armed with shotguns, and an oxcart in which his wife and seven daughters were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">traveling. Two other carts arrived later with the furniture, the baggage, and the household utensils. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He settled his family in the Hotel Jacob, while he looked for a house, and he went back to open his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">office under the protection of the soldiers. The founders of Macondo, resolving to expel the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invaders, went with their older sons to put themselves at the disposal of Jose Arcadio Buendla. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was against it, as he explained, because it was not manly to make trouble for someone in front of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his family, and Don Apolinar had returned with his wife and daughters. So he decided to resolve the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">situation in a pleasant way. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano went with him. About that time he had begun to cultivate the black mustache with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waxed tips and the somewhat stentorian voice that would characterize him in the war. Unarmed, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without paying any attention to the guards, they went into the magistrate&rsquo;s office. Don Apolinar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moscote did not lose his calm. He introduced them to two of his daughters who happened to be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there: Amparo, sixteen, dark like her mother, and Remedios, only nine, a pretty little girl with lily- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colored skin and green eyes. They were gracious and well-mannered. As soon as the men came in, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before being introduced, they gave them chairs to sit on. But they both remained standing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well, my friend,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendla said, &ldquo;you may stay here, not because you have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those bandits with shotguns at the door, but out of consideration for your wife and daughters.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don Apolinar Moscote was upset, but Jose Arcadio Buendla did not give him time to reply. &ldquo;We </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only make two conditions,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The first: that everyone can paint his house the color he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feels like. The second: that the soldiers leave at once. We will guarantee order for you.&rdquo; The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">magistrate raised his right hand with all the fingers extended. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your word of honor?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The word of your enemy,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendla said. And he added in a bitter tone: &ldquo;Because I </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">must tell you one thing: you and I are still enemies.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers left that same afternoon. A few days later Jose Arcadio Buendla found a house for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the magistrate&rsquo;s family. Everybody was at peace except Aureliano. The image of Remedios, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">magistrate&rsquo;s younger daughter, who, because of her age, could have been his daughter, kept paining </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him in some part of his body. It was a physical sensation that almost bothered him when he walked, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">like a pebble in his shoe. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">34 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 4 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE NEW HOUSE, white, like a dove, was inaugurated with a dance. Ursula had got that idea from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the afternoon when she saw Rebeca and Amaranta changed into adolescents, and it could almost </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have been said that the main reason behind the construction was a desire to have a proper place for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the girls to receive visitors. In order that nothing would be lacking in splendor she worked like a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">galley slave as the repairs were under way, so that before they were finished she had ordered costly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">necessities for the decorations, the table service, and the marvelous invention that was to arouse the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">astonishment of the town and the jubilation of the young people: the pianola. They delivered it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">broken down, packed in several boxes that were unloaded along with the Viennese furniture, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bohemian crystal, the table service from the Indies Company, the tablecloths from Holland, and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rich variety of lamps and candlesticks, hangings and drapes. The import house sent along at its own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expense an Italian expert, Pietro Crespi, to assemble and tune the pianola, to instruct the purchasers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in its functioning, and to teach them how to dance the latest music printed on its six paper rolls. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and well mannered man who had ever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been seen in Macondo, so scrupulous in his dress that in spite of the suffocating heat he would work </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in his brocade vest and heavy coat of dark cloth. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the owners of the house, he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that of Aureliano in his silverwork. One morning, without opening the door, without calling anyone </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to witness the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola and the tormenting hammering and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">constant noise of wooden lathings ceased in a silence that was startled at the order and neatness of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the music. They all ran to the parlor. Jose Arcadio Buendia was as if stmck by lightning, not because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the beauty of the melody, but because of the automatic working of the keys of the pianola, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">set up Melquiades&rsquo; camera with the hope of getting a daguerreotype of the invisible player. That day </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Italian had lunch with them. Rebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">way in which the angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulated the utensils. In the living </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room, next to the parlor, Pietro Crespi taught them how to dance. He showed them the steps </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without touching them, keeping time with a metronome, under the friendly eye of Ursula, who did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not leave the room for a moment while her daughters had their lesson. Pietro Crespi wore special </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pants on those days, very elastic and tight, and dancing slippers, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia told her. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a fairy.&rdquo; But she did not leave off her vigilance </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">until the apprenticeship was over and the Italian left Macondo. Then they began to organize the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">party. Ursula drew up a strict guest list, in which the only ones invited were the descendants of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">founders, except for the family of Pilar Ternera, who by then had had two more children by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unknown fathers. It was truly a high-class list, except that it was determined by feelings of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">friendship, for those favored were not only the oldest friends of Jose Arcadio Buendia&rsquo;s house since </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before they undertook the exodus and the founding of Macondo, but also their sons and grandsons, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who were the constant companions of Aureliano and Arcadio since infancy, and their daughters, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who were the only ones who visited the house to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta. Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the maintenance from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his scanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs, was a figurehead. In older to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">support the household expenses his daughters had opened a sewing shop, where they made felt </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flowers as well as guava delicacies, and wrote love notes to order. But in spite of being modest and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hard-working, the most beautiful girls in Iowa, and the most skilled at the new dances, they did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manage to be considered for the party. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">35 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Ursula and the girls unpacked furniture, polished silverware, and hung pictures of maidens </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in boats full of roses, which gave a breath of new life to the naked areas that the masons had built, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia stopped his pursuit of the image of God, convinced of His nonexistence, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he took the pianola apart in order to decipher its magical secret. Two days before the party, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">swamped in a shower of leftover keys and hammers, bungling in the midst of a mix-up of strings </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that would unroll in one direction and roll up again in the other, he succeeded in a fashion in putting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the instmment back together. There had never been as many surprises and as much dashing about as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in those days, but the new pitch lamps were lighted on the designated day and hour. The house was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opened, still smelling of resin and damp whitewash, and the children and grandchildren of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">founders saw the porch with ferns and begonias, the quiet rooms, the garden saturated with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fragrance of the roses, and they gathered together in the parlor, facing the unknown invention that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been covered with a white sheet. Those who were familiar with the piano, popular in other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">towns in the swamp, felt a little disheartened, but more bitter was Ursula&rsquo;s disappointment when she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put in the first roll so that Amaranta and Rebeca could begin the dancing and the mechanism did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not work. Melquiades, almost blind by then, crumbling with decrepitude, used the arts of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">timeless wisdom in an attempt to fix it. Finally Jose Arcadio Buendia managed, by mistake, to move </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a device that was stuck and the music came out, first in a burst and then in a flow of mixed-up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">notes. Beating against the strings that had been put in without order or concert and had been tuned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with temerity, the hammers let go. But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one intrepid people </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who plowed through the mountains in search of the sea to the west avoided the reefs of the melodic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mix-up and the dancing went on until dawn. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pietro Crespi came back to repair the pianola. Rebeca and Amaranta helped him put the strings </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in order and helped him with their laughter at the mix-up of the melodies. It was extremely pleasant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and so chaste in its way that Ursula ceased her vigilance. On the eve of his departure a farewell </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dance for him was improvised with the pianola and with Rebeca he put on a skillful demonstration </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of modern dance, Arcadio and Amaranta matched them in grace and skill. But the exhibition was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intermpted because Pilar Ternera, who was at the door with the onlookers, had a fight, biting and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hair pulling, with a woman who had dared to comment that Arcadio had a woman&rsquo;s behind. Toward </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">midnight Pietro Crespi took his leave with a sentimental little speech, and he promised to return </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very soon. Rebeca accompanied him to the door, and having closed up the house and put out the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lamps, she went to her room to weep. It was an inconsolable weeping that lasted for several days, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the cause of which was not known even by Amaranta. Her hermetism was not odd. Although she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seemed expansive and cordial, she had a solitary character and an impenetrable heart. She was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">splendid adolescent with long and firm bones, but she still insisted on using the small wooden </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rocking chair with which she had arrived at the house, reinforced many times and with the arms </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gone. No one had discovered that even at that age she still had the habit of sucking her finger. That </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was why she would not lose an opportunity to lock herself in the bathroom and had acquired the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">habit of sleeping with her face to the wall. On rainy afternoons, embroidering with a group of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">friends on the begonia porch, she would lose the thread of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would salt her palate when she saw the strips of damp earth and the piles of mud that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">earthworms had pushed up in the garden. Those secret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went back to eating </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">earth. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best cure </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for the temptation. And, in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth. But she persevered, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">overcome by the growing anxiety, and little by little she was getting back her ancestral appetite, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taste of primary minerals, the unbridled satisfaction of what was the original food. She would put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">handfuls of earth in her pockets, and ate them in small bits without being seen, with a confused </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feeling of pleasure and rage, as she instmcted her girl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">36 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spoke about other men, who did not deserve the sacrifice of having one eat the whitewash on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walls because of them. The handfuls of earth made the only man who deserved that show of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground that he walked on with his fine patent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leather boots in another part of the world were transmitting to her the weight and the temperature </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his blood in a mineral savor that left a harsh aftertaste in her mouth and a sediment of peace in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her heart. One afternoon, for no reason, Amparo Moscote asked permission to see the house. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta and Rebeca, disconcerted by the unexpected visit, attended her with a stiff formality. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">showed her the remodeled mansion, they had her listen to the rolls on the pianola, and they offered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her orange marmalade and crackers. Amparo gave a lesson in dignity, personal charm, and good </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manners that impressed Ursula in the few moments that she was present during the visit. After two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hours, when the conversation was beginning to wane, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distraction and gave Rebeca a letter. She was able to see the name of the Estimable Senorita Rebeca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia, written in the same methodical hand, with the same green ink, and the same delicacy of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">words with which the instructions for the operation of the pianola were written, and she folded the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letter with the tips of her fingers and hid it in her bosom, looking at Amparo Moscote with an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of complicity unto death. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sudden friendship between Amparo Moscote and Rebeca Buendia awakened the hopes of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano. The memory of little Remedios had not stopped tormenting him, but he had not found a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chance to see her. When he would stroll through town with his closest friends, Magnifico Visbal and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo Marquez&mdash;the sons of the founders of the same names&mdash;he would look for her in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sewing shop with an anxious glance, but he saw only the older sisters. The presence of Amparo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moscote in the house was like a premonition. &ldquo;She has to come with her,&rdquo; Aureliano would say to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself in a low voice. &ldquo;She has to come.&rdquo; He repeated it so many times and with such conviction </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that one afternoon when he was putting together a little gold fish in the work shop, he had the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">certainty that she had answered his call. Indeed, a short time later he heard the childish voice, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he looked up his heart froze with terror as he saw the girl at the door, dressed in pink organdy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and wearing white boots. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go in there, Remedios, Amparo Moscote said from the hall. They&rsquo;re working.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Aureliano did not give her time to respond. He picked up the little fish by the chain that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came through its mouth and said to her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios went over and asked some questions about the fish that Aureliano could not answer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because he was seized with a sudden attack of asthma. He wanted to stay beside that lily skin </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forever, beside those emerald eyes, close to that voice that called him &ldquo;sir&rdquo; with every question, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">showing the same respect that she gave her father. Melquiades was in the corner seated at the desk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scribbling indecipherable signs. Aureliano hated him. All he could do was tell Remedios that he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">going to give her the little fish and the girl was so startled by the offer that she left the workshop as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fast as she could. That afternoon Aureliano lost the hidden patience with which he had waited for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chance to see her. He neglected his work. In several desperate efforts of concentration he willed her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to appear but Remedios did not respond. He looked for her in her sisters&rsquo; shop, behind the window </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shades in her house, in her father&rsquo;s office, but he found her only in the image that saturated his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">private and terrible solitude. He would spend whole hours with Rebeca in the parlor listening to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">music on the pianola. She was listening to it because it was the music with which Pietro Crespi had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taught them how to dance. Aureliano listened to it simply because everything, even music, reminded </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him of Remedios. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The house became full of loves Aureliano expressed it in poetry that had no beginning or end. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would write it on the harsh pieces of parchment that Melquiades gave him, on the bathroom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walls, on the skin of his arms, and in all of it Remedios would appear transfigured: Remedios in the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">37 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soporific air of two in the afternoon, Remedios in the soft breath of the roses, Remedios in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">water-clock secrets of the moths, Remedios in the steaming morning bread, Remedios everywhere </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Remedios forever. Rebeca waited for her love at four in the afternoon, embroidering by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">window. She knew that the mailman&rsquo;s mule arrived only every two weeks, but she always waited for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him, convinced that he was going to arrive on some other day by mistake. It happened quite the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opposite: once the mule did not come on the usual day. Mad with desperation, Rebeca got up in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">middle of the night and ate handfuls of earth in the garden with a suicidal drive, weeping with pain </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and fury, chewing tender earthworms and chipping her teeth on snail shells. She vomited until dawn. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She fell into a state of feverish prostration, lost consciousness, and her heart went into a shameless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">delirium. Ursula, scandalized, forced the lock on her trunk and found at the bottom, tied together </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with pink ribbons, the sixteen perfumed letters and the skeletons of leaves and petals preserved in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">old books and the dried butterflies that turned to powder at the touch. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano was the only one capable of understanding such desolation. That afternoon, while </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was trying to rescue Rebeca from the slough of delirium, he went with Magnifico Visbal and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo Marquez to Catarino&rsquo;s store. The establishment had been expanded with a gallery of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wooden rooms where single women who smelled of dead flowers lived. A group made up of an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accordion and dmms played the songs of Francisco the Man, who had not been seen in Macondo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for several years. The three friends drank fermented cane juice. Magnifico and Gerineldo, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contemporaries of Aureliano but more skilled in the ways of the world, drank methodically with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">women seated on their laps. One of the women, withered and with goldwork on her teeth, gave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano a caress that made him shudder. He rejected her. He had discovered that the more he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drank the more he thought about Remedios, but he could bear the torture of his recollections better. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not know exactly when he began to float. He saw his friends and the women sailing in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">radiant glow, without weight or mass, saying words that did not come out of their mouths and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">making mysterious signals that did not correspond to their expressions. Catarino put a hand on his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shoulder and said to him: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going on eleven.&rdquo; Aureliano turned his head, saw the enormous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disfigured face with a felt flower behind the ear, and then he lost his memory, as during the times of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forgetfulness, and he recovered it on a strange dawn and in a room that was completely foreign, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where Pilar Ternera stood in her slip, barefoot, her hair down, holding a lamp over him, starded </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with disbelief. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aureliano!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano checked his feet and raised his head. He did not know how he had come there, but he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew what his aim was, because he had carried it hidden since infancy in an inviolable backwater of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his heart. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to sleep with you,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His clothes were smeared with mud and vomit. Pilar Ternera, who lived alone at that time with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her two younger children, did not ask him any quesdons. She took him to the bed. She cleaned his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">face with a damp cloth, took of his clothes, and then got completely undressed and lowered the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mosquito netting so that her children would not see them if they woke up. She had become dred of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting for the man who would stay, of the men who left, of the countless men who missed the road </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to her house, confused by the uncertainty of the cards. During the wait her skin had become </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrinkled, her breasts had withered, the coals of her heart had gone out. She felt for Aureliano in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">darkness, put her hand on his stomach and kissed him on the neck with a maternal tenderness. &ldquo;My </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">poor child,&rdquo; she murmured. Aureliano shuddered. With a calm skill, without the slightest misstep, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">left his accumulated grief behind and found Remedios changed into a swamp without horizons, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">smelling of a raw animal and recendy ironed clothes. When he came to the surface he was weeping. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First they were involuntary and broken sobs. Then he emptied himself out in an unleashed flow, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feeling that something swollen and painful had burst inside of him. She waited, snatching his head </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">38 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the tips of her fingers, until his body got rid of the dark material that would not let him live. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They Pilar Ternera asked him: &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; And Aureliano told her. She let out a laugh that in other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">times frightened the doves and that now did not even wake up the children. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to raise her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first,&rdquo; she mocked, but underneath the mockery Aureliano found a reservoir of understanding. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he went out of the room, leaving behind not only his doubts about his virility but also the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bitter weight that his heart had borne for so many months. Pilar Ternera made him a spontaneous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promise. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk to the girl,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;ll serve her on the tray.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kept her promise. But it was a bad moment, because the house had lost its peace of former </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days. When she discovered Rebeca&rsquo;s passion, which was impossible to keep secret because of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shouts, Amaranta suffered an attack of fever. She also suffered from the barb of a lonely love. Shut </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up in the bathroom, she would release herself from the torment of a hopeless passion by writing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feverish letters, which she finally hid in the bottom of her trunk. Ursula barely had the strength to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take care of the two sick girls. She was unable, after prolonged and insidious interrogations, to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ascertain the causes of Amaranta&rsquo;s prostration. Finally, in another moment of inspiration, she forced </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the lock on the trunk and found the letters tied with a pink ribbon, swollen with fresh lilies and still </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wet with tears, addressed and never sent to Pietro Crespi. Weeping with rage, she cursed the day that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it had occurred to her to buy the pianola, and she forbade the embroidery lessons and decreed a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kind of mourning with no one dead which was to be prolonged until the daughters got over their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hopes. Useless was the intervention of Jose Arcadio Buendia, who had modified his first impression </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Pietro Crespi and admired his ability in the manipulation of musical machines. So that when Pilar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ternera told Aureliano that Remedios had decided on marriage, he could see that the news would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only give his parents more trouble. Invited to the parlor for a formal interview, Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia and Ursula listened stonily to their son&rsquo;s declaration. When he learned the name of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fiancee, however, Jose Arcadio Buendia grew red with indignation. &ldquo;Love is a disease,&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thundered. &ldquo;With so many pretty and decent girls around, the only tiling that occurs to you is to get </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">married to the daughter of our enemy.&rdquo; But Ursula agreed with the choice. She confessed her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">affection for the seven Moscote sisters, for their beauty, their ability for work, their modesty, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their good manners, and she celebrated her son&rsquo;s prudence. Conquered by his wife&rsquo;s enthusiasm, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia then laid down one condition: Rebeca, who was the one he wanted, would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marry Pietro Crespi. Ursula would take Amaranta on a trip to the capital of the province when she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had time, so that contact with different people would alleviate her disappointment. Rebeca got her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">health back just as soon as she heard of the agreement, and she wrote her fiance a jubilant letter that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she submitted to her parents&rsquo; approval and put into the mail without the use of any intermediaries. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta pretended to accept the decision and little by little she recovered from her fevers, but she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promised herself that Rebeca would marry only over her dead body. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following Saturday Jose Arcadio Buendia put on his dark suit, his celluloid collar, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deerskin boots that he had worn for the first time the night of the party, and went to ask for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hand of Remedios Moscote. The magistrate and his wife received him, pleased and worried at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same time, for they did not know the reason for the unexpected visit, and then they thought that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was confused about the name of the intended bride. In order to remove the mistake, the mother </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woke Remedios up and carried her into the living room, still drowsy from sleep. They asked her if it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was tme that she had decided to get married, and she answered, whimpering, that she only wanted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them to let her sleep. Jose Arcadio Buendia, understanding the distress of the Moscotes, went to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clear things up with Aureliano. When he returned, the Moscotes had put on formal clothing, had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rearranged the furniture and put fresh flowers in the vases, and were waiting in the company of their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">older daughters. Overwhelmed by the unpleasantness of the occasion and the bothersome hard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">collar, Jose Arcadio Buendia confirmed the fact that Remedios, indeed, was the chosen one. &ldquo;It </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">39 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doesn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; Don Apolinar Moscote said with consternation. &ldquo;We have six other daughters, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all unmarried, and at an age where they deserve it, who would be delighted to be the honorable wife </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a gentleman as serious and hard-working as your son, and Aurelito lays his eyes precisely on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one who still wets her bed.&rdquo; His wife, a well-preserved woman with afflicted eyelids and expression, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scolded his mistake. When they finished the fruit punch, they willingly accepted Aureliano&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decision. Except that Senora Moscote begged the favor of speaking to Ursula alone. Intrigued, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">protesting that they were involving her in men&rsquo;s affairs, but really feeling deep emotion, Ursula went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to visit her the next day. A half hour later she returned with the news that Remedios had not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reached puberty. Aureliano did not consider that a serious barrier. He had waited so long that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could wait as long as was necessary until his bride reached the age of conception. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The newfound harmony was interrupted by the death of Melquiades. Although it was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreseeable event, the circumstances were not. A few months after his return, a process of aging had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taken place in him that was so rapid and critical that soon he was treated as one of those useless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">great-grandfathers who wander about the bedrooms like shades, dragging their feet, remembering </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">better times aloud, and whom no one bothers about or remembers really until the morning they find </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them dead in their bed. At first Jose Arcadio Buendfa helped him in his work, enthusiastic over the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">novelty of the daguerreotypes and the predictions of Nostradamus. But little by little he began </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">abandoning him to his solitude, for communication was becoming Increasingly difficult. He was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">losing his sight and his hearing, he seemed to confuse the people he was speaking to with others he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had known in remote epochs of mankind, and he would answer questions with a complex </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hodgepodge of languages. He would walk along groping in the air, although he passed between </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">objects with an inexplicable fluidity, as if be were endowed with some instinct of direction based on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an immediate prescience. One day he forgot to put in his false teeth, which at night he left in a glass </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of water beside his bed, and he never put them in again. When Ursula undertook the enlargement of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house, she had them build him a special room next to Aureliano&rsquo;s workshop, far from the noise </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and bustle of the house, with a window flooded with light and a bookcase where she herself put in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">order the books that were almost destroyed by dust and moths, the flaky stacks of paper covered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with indecipherable signs, and the glass with his false teeth, where some aquatic plants with tiny </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">yellow flowers had taken root. The new place seemed to please Melquiades, because he was never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seen any more, not even in the dining room, He only went to Aureliano&rsquo;s workshop, where he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would spend hours on end scribbling his enigmatic literature on the parchments that he had brought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with him and that seemed to have been made out of some dry material that crumpled like puff paste. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There he ate the meals that Visitacion brought him twice a day, although in the last days he lost his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appetite and fed only on vegetables. He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His skin became covered with a thin moss, similar to that which flourished on the antique vest that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he never took off, and his breath exhaled the odor of a sleeping animal. Aureliano ended up forget&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ting about him, absorbed in the composition of his poems, but on one occasion he thought he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understood something of what Melquiades was saying in his groping monologues, and he paid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention. In reality, the only tiling that could be isolated in the rocky paragraphs was the insistent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hammering on the word equinox, equinox, equinox , and the name of Alexander von Humboldt. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio got a little closer to him when he began to help Aureliano in his silverwork. Melquiades </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">answered that effort at communication at times by giving forth with phrases in Spanish that had very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">little to do with reality. One afternoon, however, he seemed to be illuminated by a sudden emotion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Years later, facing the firing squad, Arcadio would remember the trembling with which Melquiades </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made him listen to several pages of his impenetrable writing, which of course he did not understand, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but which when read aloud were like encyclicals being chanted. Then he smiled for the first time in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">long while and said in Spanish: &ldquo;When I die, burn mercury in my room for three days.&rdquo; Arcadio told </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that to Jose Arcadio Buendfa and the latter tried to get more explicit information, but he received </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">40 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only one answer: &ldquo;I have found immortality.&rdquo; When Melquiades&rsquo; breathing began to smell, Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took him to bathe in the river on Thursday mornings. He seemed to get better. He would undress </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and get into the water with the boys, and his mysterious sense of orientation would allow him to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">avoid the deep and dangerous spots. &ldquo;We come from the water,&rdquo; he said on a certain occasion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Much time passed in that way without anyone&rsquo;s seeing him in the house except on the night when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he made a pathetic effort to fix the pianola, and when he would go to the river with Arcadio, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carrying under his arm a gourd and a bar of palm oil soap wrapped in a towel. One Thursday before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they called him to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: &ldquo;I have died of fever on the dunes of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Singapore.&rdquo; That day he went into the water at a bad spot and they did not find him until the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">following day, a few miles downstream, washed up on a bright bend in the river and with a solitary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vulture sitting on his stomach. Over the scandalized protests of Ursula, who wept with more grief </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than she had had for her own father, Jose Arcadio Buendia was opposed to their burying him. &ldquo;He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">is immortal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he himself revealed the formula of his resurrection.&rdquo; He brought out the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forgotten water pipe and put a kettle of mercury to boil next to the body, which little by little was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">filling with blue bubbles. Don Apolinar Moscote ventured to remind him that an unburied drowned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man was a danger to public health. &ldquo;None of that, because he&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; was the answer of Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia, who finished the seventy-two hours with the mercurial incense as the body was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">already beginning to burst with a livid fluorescence, the soft whistles of which impregnated the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house with a pestilential vapor. Only then did he permit them to bury him, not in any ordinary way, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but with the honors reserved for Macondo&rsquo;s greatest benefactor. It was the first burial and the best- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attended one that was ever seen in the town, only surpassed, a century later, by Big Mama&rsquo;s funeral </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carnival. They buried him in a grave dug in the center of the plot destined for the cemetery, with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stone on which they wrote the only thing they knew about him: MELQUIADES. They gave him his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nine nights of wake. In the tumult that gathered in the courtyard to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cards. Amaranta found a chance to confess her love to Pietro Crespi, who a few weeks before had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">formalized his promise to Rebeca and had set up a store for musical instruments and mechanical </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">toys in the same section where the Arabs had lingered in other times swapping knickknacks for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">macaws, and which the people called the Street of the Turks. The Italian, whose head covered with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patent leather curls aroused in women an irrepressible need to sigh, dealt with Amaranta as with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">capricious little girl who was not worth taking seriously. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have a younger brother,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to help me in the store.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta felt humiliated and told Pietro Crespi with a virulent anger that she was prepared to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stop her sister&rsquo;s wedding even if her own dead body had to lie across the door. The Italian was so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impressed by the dramatics of the threat that he could not resist the temptation to mention it to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca. That was how Amaranta&rsquo;s trip, always put off by Ursula&rsquo;s work, was arranged in less than a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">week. Amaranta put up no resistance, but when she kissed Rebeca good-bye she whispered in her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ear: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up. Even if they send me to the ends of the earth I&rsquo;ll find some way of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stopping you from getting married, even if I have to kill you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the absence of Ursula, with the invisible presence of Melquiades, who continued his stealthy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shuffling through the rooms, the house seemed enormous and empty. Rebeca took charge of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">domestic order, while the Indian woman took care of the bakery. At dusk, when Pietro Crespi would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arrive, preceded by a cool breath of lavender and always bringing a toy as a gift, his fiancee would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">receive the visitor in the main parlor with doors and windows open to be safe from any suspicion. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was an unnecessary precaution, for the Italian had shown himself to be so respectful that he did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even touch the hand of the woman who was going to be his wife within the year. Those visits were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">filling the house with remarkable toys. Mechanical ballerinas, music boxes, acrobatic monkeys, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trotting horses, clowns who played the tambourine: the rich and startling mechanical fauna that </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">41 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pietro Crespi brought dissipated Jose Arcadio Buendia&rsquo;s affliction over the death of Melquiades and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carried him back to his old days as an alchemist. He lived at that time in a paradise of disemboweled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">animals, of mechanisms that had been taken apart in an attempt to perfect them with a system of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perpetual motion based upon the principles of the pendulum. Aureliano, for his part, had neglected </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the workshop in order to teach little Remedios to read and write. At first the child preferred her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dolls to the man who would come every afternoon and who was responsible for her being separated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from her toys in order to be bathed and dressed and seated in the parlor to receive the visitor. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano&rsquo;s patience and devotion finally won her over, up to the point where she would spend </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many hours with him studying the meaning of the letters and sketching in a notebook with colored </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pencils little houses with cows in the corral and round suns with yellow rays that hid behind the hills. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only Rebeca was unhappy, because of Amaranta&rsquo;s threat. She knew her sister&rsquo;s character, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">haughtiness of her spirit, and she was frightened by the virulence of her anger. She would spend </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whole hours sucking her finger in the bathroom, holding herself back with an exhausting iron will so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as not to eat earth. In search of some relief for her uncertainty, she called Pilar Ternera to read her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">future. After a string of conventional vagaries, Pilar Ternera predicted: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You will not be happy as long as your parents remain unburied.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca shuddered. As in the memory of a dream she saw herself entering the house as a very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">small girl, with the trunk and the little rocker, and a bag whose contents she had never known. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remembered a bald gentleman dressed in linen and with his collar closed by a gold button, who had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nothing to do with the king of hearts. She remembered a very young and beautiful woman with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">warm and perfumed hands, who had nothing in common with the jack of diamonds and Inis </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rheumatic hands, and who used to put flowers in her hair and take her out walking in the afternoon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through a town with green streets. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pilar Ternera seemed disconcerted: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either, but that&rsquo;s what the cards say.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca was so preoccupied with the enigma that she told it to Jose Arcadio Buendia, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scolded her for believing in the predictions of the cards, but he undertook the silent task of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">searching closets and trunks, moving furniture and turning over beds and floorboards looking for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bag of bones. He remembered that he had not seen it since the time of the rebuilding. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secretly summoned the masons and one of them revealed that he had walled up the bag in some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom because it bothered him in his work. After several days of listening, with their ears against </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the walls, they perceived the deep cloc-cloc. They penetrated the wall and there were the bones in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intact bag. They buried it the same day in a grave without a stone next to that of Melquiades, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia returned home free of a burden that for a moment had weighed on his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conscience as much as the memory of Prudencio Aguilar. When he went through the kitchen he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kissed Rebeca on the forehead. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get those bad thoughts out of your head,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be happy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The friendship with Rebeca opened up to Pilar Ternera the doors of the house, closed by Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since the birth of Arcadio. She would arrive at any hour of the day, like a flock of goats, and would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unleash her feverish energy in the hardest tasks. Sometimes she would go into the workshop and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">help Arcadio sensitize the daguerreotype plates with an efficiency and a tenderness that ended up by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confusing him. That woman bothered him. The tan of her skin, her smell of smoke, the disorder of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her laughter in the darkroom distracted his attention and made him bump into things. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On a certain occasion Aureliano was there working on his silver, and Pilar Ternera leaned over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the table to admire his laborious patience. Suddenly it happened. Aureliano made sure that Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was in the darkroom before raising his eyes and meeting those of Pilar Ternera, whose thought was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perfectly visible, as if exposed to the light of noon. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">42 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Aureliano said. &ldquo;Tell me what it is.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pilar Ternera bit her lips with a sad smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That you&rsquo;d be good in a war,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where you put your eye, you put your bullet.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano relaxed with the proof of the omen. He went back to concentrate on his work as if </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nothing had happened, and his voice took on a restful strength. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will recognize him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bear my name.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia finally got what he was looking for: he connected the mechanism of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clock to a mechanical ballerina, and the toy danced uninterruptedly to the rhythm of her own music </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for three days. That discovery excited him much more than any of his other harebrained </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">undertakings. He stopped eating. He stopped sleeping. Only the vigilance and care of Rebeca kept </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him from being dragged off by his imagination into a state of perpetual delirium from which he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would not recover. He would spend the nights walking around the room thinking aloud, searching </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for a way to apply the principles of the pendulum to oxcarts, to harrows, to everything that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">useful when put into motion. The fever of insomnia fatigued him so much that one dawn he could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not recognize the old man with white hair and uncertain gestures who came into his bedroom. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was Prudencio Aguilar. When he finally identified him, startled that the dead also aged, Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia felt himself shaken by nostalgia. &ldquo;Prudencio,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come from a long way </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off!&rdquo; After many years of death the yearning for the living was so intense, the need for company so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pressing, so terrifying the neatness of that other death which exists within death, that Pmdencio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aguilar had ended up loving his worst enemy. He had spent a great deal of time looking for him. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked the dead from Riohacha about him, the dead who came from the Upar Valley, those who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came from the swamp, and no one could tell him because Macondo was a town that was unknown </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the dead until Melqufades arrived and marked it with a small black dot on the motley maps of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death. Jose Arcadio Buendia conversed with Prudencio Aguilar until dawn. A few hours later, worn </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out by the vigil, he went into Aureliano&rsquo;s workshop and asked him: &ldquo;What day is today?&rdquo; Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">told him that it was Tuesday. &ldquo;I was thinking the same thing,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia said, &ldquo;but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suddenly I realized that it&rsquo;s still Monday, like yesterday. Look at the sky, look at the walls, look at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">begonias. Today is Monday too.&rdquo; Used to his manias, Aureliano paid no attention to him. On the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">next day, Wednesday, Jose Arcadio Buendia went back to the workshop. &ldquo;This is a disaster,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday too.&rdquo; That night Pietro Crespi found him on the porch, weeping for Prudencio Aguilar, for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melqufades, for Rebeca&rsquo;s parents, for his mother and father, for all of those he could remember and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who were now alone in death. He gave him a mechanical bear that walked on its hind legs on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tightrope, but he could not distract him from his obsession. He asked him what had happened to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the project he had explained to him a few days before about the possibility of building a pendulum </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">machine that would help men to fly and he answered that it was impossible because a pendulum </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could lift anything into the air but it could not lift itself. On Thursday he appeared in the workshop </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again with the painful look of plowed ground. &ldquo;The time machine has broken,&rdquo; he almost sobbed, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;and Ursula and Amaranta so far away!&rdquo; Aureliano scolded him like a child and he adopted a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contrite air. He spent six hours examining things, trying to find a difference from their appearance </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the previous day in the hope of discovering in them some change that would reveal the passage </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of time. He spent the whole night in bed with his eyes open, calling to Prudencio Aguilar, to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades, to all the dead, so that they would share his distress. But no one came. On Friday, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before anyone arose, he watched the appearance of nature again until he did not have the slightest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doubt but that it was Monday. Then he grabbed the bar from a door and with the savage violence of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his uncommon strength he smashed to dust the equipment in the alchemy laboratory, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">daguerreotype room, the silver workshop, shouting like a man possessed in some high-sounding and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fluent but completely incomprehensible language. He was about to finish off the rest of the house </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">43 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when Aureliano asked the neighbors for help. Ten men were needed to get him down, fourteen to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tie him up, twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the courtyard, where they left him tied up, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barking in the strange language and giving off a green froth at the mouth. When Ursula and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta returned he was still tied to the tmnk of the chestnut tree by his hands and feet, soaked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with rain and in a state of total innocence. They spoke to him and he looked at them without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recognizing them, saying things they did not understand. Ursula untied his wrists and ankles, lacer&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ated by the pressure of the rope, and left him tied only by the waist. Later on they built him a shelter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of palm brandies to protect him from the sun and the rain. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">44 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 5 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">AURELIANO BUENDIA and Remedios Moscote were married one Sunday in March before the altar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Father Nicanor Reyna had set up in the parlor. It was the culmination of four weeks of shocks in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moscote household because little Remedios had reached puberty before getting over the habits of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">childhood. In spite of the fact that her mother had taught her about the changes of adolescence, one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">February afternoon she burst shouting into the living room, where her sisters were chatting with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, and showed them her panties, smeared with a chocolate-colored paste. A month for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding was agreed upon. There was barely enough time to teach her how to wash herself, get </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dressed by herself, and understand the fundamental business of a home. They made her urinate over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hot bricks in order to cure her of the habit of wetting her bed. It took a good deal of work to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convince her of the inviolability of the marital secret, for Remedios was so confused and at the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time so amazed at the revelation that she wanted to talk to everybody about the details of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding night. It was a fatiguing effort, but on the date set for the ceremony the child was as adept </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the ways of the world as any of her sisters. Don Apolinar Moscote escorted her by the arm down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the street that was decorated with flowers and wreaths amidst the explosion of rockets and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">music of several bands, and she waved with her hand and gave her thanks with a smile to those who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wished her good luck from the windows. Aureliano, dressed in black, wearing the same patent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leather boots with metal fasteners that he would have on a few years later as he faced the firing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">squad, had an intense paleness and a hard lump in his throat when he met the bride at the door of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house and led her to the altar. She behaved as naturally, with such discretion, that she did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lose her composure, not even when Aureliano dropped the ring as he tried to put it on her finger. In </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the midst of the. murmurs and confusion of the guests, she kept her arm with the fingerless lace </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">glove held up and remained like that with her ring finger ready until the bridegroom managed to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stop the ring with his foot before it rolled to the door, and came back blushing to the altar. Her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mother and sisters suffered so much from the fear that the child would do something wrong during </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the ceremony that in the end they were the ones who committed the impertinence of picking her up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to kiss her. From that day on the sense of responsibility, the natural grace, the calm control that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios would have in the face of adverse circumstances was revealed. It was she who, on her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">own initiative, put aside the largest piece that she had cut from the wedding cake and took it on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plate with a fork to Jose Arcadio Buendfa. Tied to the tmnk of the chestnut tree, huddled on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wooden stool underneath the palm shelter, the enormous old man, discolored by the sun and rain, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made a vague smile of gratitude and at the piece of cake with his fingers, mumbling an unintelligible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">psalm. The only unhappy person in that noisy celebration, which lasted until dawn on Monday, was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca Buendfa. It was her own frustrated party. By an arrangement of Ursula&rsquo;s, her marriage was to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">be celebrated on the same day, but that Friday Pietro Crespi received a letter with the news of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mother&rsquo;s imminent death. The wedding was postponed. Pietro Crespi left for the capital of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">province an hour after receiving the letter, and on the road he missed his mother, who arrived </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">punctually Saturday night and at Aureliano&rsquo;s wedding sang the sad aria that she had prepared for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding of her son. Pietro Crespi returned on Sunday midnight to sweep up the ashes of the party, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">after having worn out five horses on the road in an attempt to be in time for his wedding. It was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">never discovered who wrote the letter. Tormented by Ursula, Amaranta wept with indignation and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">swore her innocence in front of the altar, which the carpenters had not finished dismantling. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Father Nicanor Reyna&mdash;whom Don Apolinar Moscote had brought from the swamp to officiate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at the wedding&mdash;was an old man hardened by the ingratitude of his ministry. His skin was sad, with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bones almost exposed, and he had a pronounced round stomach and the expression of an old </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">45 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">angel, which came more from, simplicity than from goodness. He had planned to return to his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pariah after the wedding, but he was appalled at the hardness of the inhabitants of Macondo, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were prospering in the midst of scandal, subject to the natural law, without baptizing their children </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">or sanctifying their festivals. Thinking that no land needed the seed of God so much, he decided to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stay on for another week to Christianize both circumcised and gentile, legalize concubinage, and give </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the sacraments to the dying. But no one paid any attention to him. They would answer him that they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been many years without a priest, arranging the business of their souls directly with God, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that they had lost the evil of original sin. Tired of preaching in the open, Father Nicanor decided to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">undertake the building of a church, the largest in the world, with life-size saints and stained-glass </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">windows on the sides, so that people would come from Rome to honor God in the center of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impiety. He went everywhere begging alms with a copper dish. They gave him a large amount, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he wanted more, because the church had to have a bell that would raise the drowned up to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surface of the water. He pleaded so much that he lost his voice. His bones began to fill with sounds. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One Saturday, not even having collected the price of the doors, he fell into a desperate confusion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He improvised an altar in the square and on Sunday he went through the town with a small bell, as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the days of insomnia, calling people to an open-air mass. Many went out of curiosity. Others from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nostalgia. Others so that God would not take the disdain for His intermediary as a personal insult. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that at eight in the morning half the town was in the square, where Father Nicanor chanted the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gospels in a voice that had been lacerated by his pleading. At the end, when the congregation began </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to break up, he raised his arms signaling for attention. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now we shall witness an undeniable proof of the infinite power of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The boy who had helped him with the mass brought him a cup of thick and steaming chocolate, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which he drank without pausing to breathe. Then he wiped his lips with a handkerchief that he drew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from his sleeve, extended his arms, and closed his eyes. Thereupon Father Nicanor rose six inches </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">above the level of the ground. It was a convincing measure. He went among the houses for several </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days repeating the demonstration of levitation by means of chocolate while the acolyte collected so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much money in a bag that in less than a month he began the construction of the church. No one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doubted the divine origin of the demonstration except Jose Arcadio Buendfa, who without changing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression watched the troop of people who gathered around the chestnut tree one morning to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">witness the revelation once more. He merely stretched on his stool a little and shrugged his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shoulders when Father Nicanor began to rise up from the ground along with the chair he was sitting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hoc est simplicissimus. ,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia said. &ldquo;Homo iste statum quartum materiae invent.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Father Nicanor raised his hands and the four legs of the chair all landed on the ground at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same time. &ldquo; Nego ,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Factum hoc existentiam Dei prohat sine dubio.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus it was discovered that Jose Arcadio Buendfa&rsquo;s devilish jargon was Latin. Father Nicanor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took advantage of the circumstance of his being the only person who had been able to communicate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with him to try to inject the faith into his twisted mind. Every afternoon he would sit by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chestnut tree preaching in Latin, but Jose Arcadio Buendfa insisted on rejecting rhetorical tricks and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the transmutation of chocolate, and he demanded the daguerreotype of God as the only proof. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Father Nicanor then brought him medals and pictures and even a reproduction of the Veronica, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendfa rejected them as artistic objects without any scientific basis. He was so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stubborn that Father Nicanor gave up his attempts at evangelization and continued visiting him out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of humanitarian feelings. But then it was Jose Arcadio Buendia who took the lead and tried to break </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down the priest&rsquo;s faith with rationalist tricks. On a certain occasion when Father Nicanor brought a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">checker set to the chestnut tree and invited him to a game, Jose Arcadio Buendia would not accept, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because according to him he could never understand the sense of a contest in which the two </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">46 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">adversaries have agreed upon the rules. Father Nicanor, who had never seen checkers played that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">way, could not play it again. Ever more startled at Jose Arcadio Buendia&rsquo;s lucidity, he asked him how </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it was possible that they had him tied to a tree. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hoc est simplicissimus&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m Crazy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From then on, concerned about his own faith, the priest did not come back to visit him and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dedicated himself to hurrying along the building of the church. Rebeca felt her hopes being reborn. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her future was predicated on the completion of the work, for one Sunday when Father Nicanor was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lunching at the house and the whole family sitting at the table spoke of the solemnity and splendor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that religious ceremonies would acquire when the church was built, Amaranta said: &ldquo;The luckiest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one will be Rebeca.&rdquo; And since Rebeca did not understand what she meant, she explained it to her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with an innocent smile: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be the one who will inaugurate the church with your wedding.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca tried to forestall any comments. The way the construction was going the church would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not be built before another ten years. Father Nicanor did not agree: the growing generosity of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">faithful permitted him to make more optimistic calculations. To the mute Indignation of Rebeca, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who could not finish her lunch, Ursula celebrated Amaranta&rsquo;s idea and contributed a considerable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sum for the work to move faster. Father Nicanor felt that with another contribution like that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">church would be ready within three years. From then on Rebeca did not say another word to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta, convinced that her initiative had not the innocence that she attempted to give it. &ldquo;That </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was the least serious thing I could have done,&rdquo; Amaranta answered her during the violent argument </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had that night. &ldquo;In that way I won&rsquo;t have to kill you for three years.&rdquo; Rebeca accepted the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">challenge. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Pietro Crespi found out about the new postponement, he went through a crisis of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disappointment, but Rebeca gave him a final proof of her loyalty. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll elope whenever you say,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she told him. Pietro Crespi, however, was not a man of adventure. He lacked the impulsive character </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his fiancee and he considered respect for one&rsquo;s given word as a wealth that should not be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">squandered. Then Rebeca turned to more audacious methods. A mysterious wind blew out the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lamps in the parlor and Ursula surprised the lovers kissing in the dark. Pietro Crespi gave her some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confused explanations about the poor quality of modern pitch lamps and he even helped her install a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more secure system of illumination for the room. But the fuel failed again or the wicks became </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clogged and Ursula found Rebeca sitting on her fiance&rsquo;s lap. This time she would accept no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">explanation. She turned the responsibility of the bakery over to the Indian woman and sat in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rocking chair to watch over the young people during the visits, ready to win out over maneuvers that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had already been old when she was a girl. &ldquo;Poor Mama,&rdquo; Rebeca would say with mock indignation, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seeing Ursula yawn during the boredom of the visits. &ldquo;When she dies she&rsquo;ll go off to her reward in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that rocking chair.&rdquo; After three months of supervised love, fatigued by the slow progress of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">construction, which he went to inspect every day, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">money he needed to finish the church. Amaranta did not grow impatient. As she conversed with her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">girl friends every afternoon when they came to embroider on the porch, she tried to think of new </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">subterfuges. A mistake in calculation spoiled the one she considered the most effective: removing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the mothballs that Rebeca had put in her wedding dress before she put it away in the bedroom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dresser. She did it when two months were left for the completion of the church. But Rebeca was so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impatient with the approach of the wedding that she wanted to get the dress ready earlier than </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta had foreseen. When she opened the dresser and unfolded first the papers and then the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">protective cloth, she found the fabric of the dress and the stitches of the veil and even the crown of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">orange blossoms perforated by moths. Although she was sure that she had put a handful of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mothballs in the wrappings, the disaster seemed so natural that she did not dare blame Amaranta. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was less than a month until the wedding, but Amparo Moscote promised to sew a new dress </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">47 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">within a week. Amaranta felt faint that rainy noontime when Amparo came to the house wrapped in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the froth of needlework for Rebeca to have the final fitting of the dress. She lost her voice and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thread of cold sweat ran down the path of her spine. For long months she had trembled with fright </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting for that hour, because if she had not been able to conceive the ultimate obstacle to Rebeca&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding, she was sure that at the last moment, when all the resources of her imagination had failed, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she would have the courage to poison her. That afternoon, while Rebeca was suffocating with heat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inside the armor of thread that Amparo Moscote was putting about her body with thousands of pins </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and infinite patience, Amaranta made several mistakes in her crocheting and pricked her finger with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the needle, but she decided with frightful coldness that the date would be the last Friday before the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding and the method would be a dose of laudanum in her coffee. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A greater obstacle, as impassable as it was unforeseen, obliged a new and indefinite </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">postponement. One week before the date set for the wedding, little Remedios woke up in the middle </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the night soaked in a hot broth which had exploded in her insides with a kind of tearing belch, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she died three days later, poisoned by her own blood, with a pair of twins crossed in her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stomach. Amarante suffered a crisis of conscience. She had begged God with such fervor for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">something fearful to happen so that she would not have to poison Rebeca that she felt guilty of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios&rsquo; death. That was not the obstacle that she had begged for so much. Remedios had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought a breath of merriment to the house. She had settled down with her husband in a room near </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the workshop, which she decorated with the dolls and toys of her recent childhood, and her merry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vitality overflowed the four walls of the bedroom and went like a whirlwind of good health along the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">porch with the begonias: She would start singing at dawn. She was the only person who dared </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intervene in the arguments between Rebeca and Amaranta. She plunged into the fatiguing chore of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taking care of Jose Arcadio Buendfa. She would bring him his food, she would help him with Iris </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">daily necessities, wash him with soap and a scrubbing brush, keep his hair and beard free of lice and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nits, keep the palm shelter in good condition and reinforce it with waterproof canvas in stormy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weather. In her last months she had succeeded in communicating with him in phrases of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rudimentary Latin. When the son of Aureliano and Pilar Ternera was born and brought to the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and baptized in an intimate ceremony with the name Aureliano Jose, Remedios decided that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be considered their oldest child. Her maternal instinct surprised Ursula. Aureliano, for his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">part, found in her the justification that he needed to live. He worked all day in his workshop and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios would bring him a cup of black coffee in the middle of the morning. They would both </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">visit the Moscotes every night. Aureliano would play endless games of dominoes with his father-in- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">law while Remedios chatted with her sisters or talked to her mother about more important things. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The link with the Buendfas consolidated Don Apolinar Moscote&rsquo;s authority in the town. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frequent trips to the capital of the province he succeeded in getting the government to build a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">school so that Arcadio, who had inherited the educational enthusiasm of his grandfather, could take </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">charge of it. Through persuasion he managed to get the majority of houses painted blue in time for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the date of national independence. At the urging of Father Nicanor, he arranged for the transfer of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Catarino&rsquo;s store to a back street and he closed down several scandalous establishments that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prospered in the center of town. Once he returned with six policemen armed with rifles to whom he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">entrusted the maintenance of order, and no one remembered the original agreement not to have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armed men in the town. Aureliano enjoyed his father-in-law&rsquo;s efficiency. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get as fat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as he is,&rdquo; his friends would say to him. But his sedentary life, which accentuated his cheekbones and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concentrated the sparkle of his eyes, did not increase his weight or alter the parsimony of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">character, but, on the contrary, it hardened on his lips the straight line of solitary meditation and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">implacable decision. So deep was the affection that he and his wife had succeeded in arousing in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">both their families that when Remedios announced that she was going to have a child, even Rebeca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Amaranta declared a tmce in order to knit items in blue wool if it was to be a boy and in pink </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">48 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wool in case it was a girl. She was the last person Arcadio thought about a few years later when he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">faced the firing squad. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula ordered a mourning period of closed doors and windows, with no one entering or leaving </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">except on matters of utmost necessity. She prohibited any talking aloud for a year and she put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios&rsquo; daguerreotype in the place where her body had been laid out, with a black ribbon around </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it and an oil lamp that was always kept lighted. Future generations, who never let the lamp go out, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be puzzled at that girl in a pleated skirt, white boots, and with an organdy band around her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">head, and they were never able to connect her with the standard image of a great-grandmother. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta took charge of Aureliano Jose. She adopted him as a son who would share her solitude </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and relieve her from the involutary laudanum that her mad beseeching had thrown into Remedios&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">coffee. Pietro Crespi would tiptoe in at dusk, with a black ribbon on his hat, and he would pay a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">silent visit to Rebeca, who seemed to be bleeding to death inside the black dress with sleeves down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to her wrists. Just the idea of thinking about a new date for the wedding would have been so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">irreverent that the engagement turned into an eternal relationship, a fatigued love that no one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worried about again, as if the lovers, who in other days had sabotaged the lamps in order to kiss, had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been abandoned to the free will of death. Having lost her bearings, completely demoralized, Rebeca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began eating earth again. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly&mdash;when the mourning had gone on so long that the needlepoint sessions began again&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">someone pushed open the street door at two in the afternoon in the mortal silence of the heat and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the braces in the foundation shook with such force that Amaranta and her friends sewing on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">porch, Rebeca sucking her finger in her bedroom, Ursula in the kitchen, Aureliano in the workshop, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and even Jose Arcadio Buendfa under the solitary chestnut tree had the impression that an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">earthquake was breaking up the house. A huge man had arrived. His square shoulders barely fitted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the doorways. He was wearing a medal of Our Lady of Help around his bison neck, his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arms and chest were completely covered with cryptic tattooing, and on his right wrist was the tight </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">copper bracelet of the ninos-en-cru ^ amulet. His skin was tanned by the salt of the open air, his hair </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was short and straight like the mane of a mule, his jaws were of iron, and he wore a sad smile. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had a belt on that was twice as thick as the cinch of a horse, boots with leggings and spurs and iron </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the heels, and his presence gave the quaking impression of a seismic tremor. He went through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the parlor and the living room, carrying some half-worn saddlebags in his hand, and he appeared like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a thunderclap on the porch with the begonias where Amaranta and her friends were paralyzed, their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">needles in the air. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said to them in a tired voice, threw the saddlebags on a worktable, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went by on his way to the back of the house. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said to the startled Rebecca, who saw him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pass by the door of her bedroom. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said to Aureliano, who was at his silversmith&rsquo;s bench </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with all five senses alert. He did not linger with anyone. He went directly to the kitchen and there he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stopped for the first time at the end of a trip that had begun of the other side of the world. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he said. Ursula stood for a fraction of a second with her mouth open, looked into his eyes, gave a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cry, and flung her arms around his neck, shouting and weeping with joy. It was Jose Arcadio. He was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returning as poor as when he had left, to such an extreme that Ursula had to give him two pesos to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pay for the rental of his horse. He spoke a Spanish that was larded with sailor slang. They asked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where he had been and he answered: &ldquo;Out there.&rdquo; He hung his hammock in the room they assigned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him and slept for three days. When he woke up, after eating sixteen raw eggs, he went directly to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Catarino&rsquo;s store, where his monumental size provoked a panic of curiosity among the women. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">called for music and cane liquor for everyone, to be put on his bill. He would Indian-wrestle with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">five men at the same time. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; they said, convinced that they would not be able to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">move his arm. &ldquo;He has ninos-en-cru Catarino, who did not believe in magical tricks of strength, bet </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him twelve pesos that he could not move the counter. Jose Arcadio pulled it out of its place, lifted it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over his head, and put it in the street. It took eleven men to put it back. In the heat of the party he </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">49 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exhibited his unusual masculinity on the bar, completely covered with tattoos of words in several </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">languages intertwined in blue and red. To the women who were besieging him and coveting him he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put the question as to who would pay the most. The one who had the most money offered him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twenty pesos. Then he proposed raffling himself off among them at ten pesos a chance. It was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fantastic price because the most sought-after woman earned eight pesos a night, but they all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accepted. They wrote their names on fourteen pieces of paper which they put into a hat and each </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman took one out. When there were only two pieces left to draw, it was established to whom they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">belonged. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Five pesos more from each one,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio proposed, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll share myself with both. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He made his living that way. He had been around the world sixty-five times, enlisted in a crew of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sailors without a country. The women who went to bed with him that night in Catarino&rsquo;s store </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought him naked into the dance salon so that people could see that there was not a square inch of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his body that was not tattooed, front and back, and from his neck to his toes. He did not succeed in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">becoming incorporated into the family. He slept all day and spent the night in the red-light district, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">making bets on his strength. On the rare occasions when Ursula got him to sit down at the table, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave signs of radiant good humor, especially when he told about his adventures in remote countries. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had been shipwrecked and spent two weeks adrift in the Sea of Japan, feeding on the body of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">comrade who had succumbed to sunstroke and whose extremely salty flesh as it cooked in the sun </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had a sweet and granular taste. Under a bright noonday sun in the Gulf of Bengal his ship had lulled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a sea dragon, in the stomach of which they found the helmet, the buckles, and the weapons of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Crusader. In the Caribbean he had seen the ghost of the pirate ship of Victor Hugues, with its sails </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">torn by the winds of death, the masts chewed by sea worms, and still looking for the course to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guadeloupe. Ursula would weep at the table as if she were reading the letters that had never arrived </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and in which Jose Arcadio told about his deeds and misadventures. &ldquo;And there was so much of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">home here for you, my son,&rdquo; she would sob, &ldquo;and so much food thrown to the hogs!&rdquo; But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">underneath it an she could not conceive that the boy the gypsies took away was the same lout who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would eat half a suckling pig for lunch and whose flatulence withered the flowers. Something similar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took place with the rest of the family. Amaranta could not conceal the repugnance that she felt at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the table because of his bestial belching. Arcadio, who never knew the secret of their relationship, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scarcely answered the questions that he asked with the obvious idea of gaining his affection. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano tried to relive the times when they slept in the same room, tried to revive the complicity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of childhood, but Jose Arcadio had forgotten about it, because life at sea had saturated his memory </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with too many things to remember. Only Rebeca succumbed to the first impact. The day that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saw him pass by her bedroom she thought that Pietro Crespi was a sugary dandy next to that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">protomale whose volcanic breathing could be heard all over the house. She tried to get near him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">under any pretext. On a certain occasion Jose Arcadio looked at her body with shameless attention </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and said to her &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a woman, little sister.&rdquo; Rebeca lost control of herself. She went back to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eating earth and the whitewash on the walls with the avidity of previous days, and she sucked her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finger with so much anxiety that she developed a callus on her thumb. She vomited up a green liquid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with dead leeches in it. She spent nights awake shaking with fever, fighting against delirium, waiting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">until the house shook with the return of Jose Arcadio at dawn. One afternoon, when everyone was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">having a siesta, she could no longer resist and went to his bedroom. She found him in his shorts, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lying in the hammock that he had hung from the beams with a ship&rsquo;s hawser. She was so impressed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by his enormous motley nakedness that she felt an impulse to retreat. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">didn&rsquo;t know you were here.&rdquo; But she lowered her voice so as not to wake anyone up. &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he said. Rebeca obeyed. She stopped beside the hammock in an icy sweat, feeling knots forming in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her intestines, while Jose Arcadio stroked her ankles with the tips of his fingers, then her calves, then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her thighs, murmuring: &ldquo;Oh, little sister, little sister.&rdquo; She had to make a supernatural effort not to </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">50 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">die when a startlingly regulated cyclonic power lifted her up by the waist and despoiled her of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intimacy with three clashes of its claws and quartered her like a little bird. She managed to thank </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">God for having been born before she lost herself in the inconceivable pleasure of that unbearable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pain, splashing in the steaming marsh of the hammock which absorbed the explosion of blood like a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">blotter. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three days later they were married during the five-o&rsquo;clock mass. Jose Arcadio had gone to Pietro </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Crespi&rsquo;s store the day before. He found him giving a zither lesson and did not draw him aside to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">speak to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry Rebeca,&rdquo; he told him. Pietro Crespi turned pale, gave the zither to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one of his pupils, and dismissed the class. When they were alone in the room that was crowded with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">musical instruments and mechanical toys, Pietro Crespi said: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your sister.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio replied. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pietro Crespi mopped his brow with the handkerchief that was soaked in lavender. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against nature,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and besides, it&rsquo;s against the law.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio grew impatient, not so much at the argument as over Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s paleness. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fuck nature two times over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve come to tell you not to bother going to ask </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca anything.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But his brutal deportment broke down when he saw Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s eyes grow moist. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to him in a different tone, &ldquo;if you really like the family, there&rsquo;s Amaranta for </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bdquo; ?? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Father Nicanor revealed in his Sunday sermon that Jose Arcadio and Rebeca were not brother </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and sister. Ursula never forgave what she considered an inconceivable lack of respect and when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came back from church she forbade the newlyweds to set foot in the house again. For her it was as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">if they were dead. So they rented a house across from the cemetery and established themselves there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with no other furniture but Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s hammock. On their wedding night a scorpion that had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">got into her slipper bit Rebeca on the foot. Her tongue went to sleep, but that did not stop them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from spending a scandalous honeymoon. The neighbors were startled by the cries that woke up the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whole district as many as eight times in a single night and three times during siesta, and they prayed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that such wild passion would not disturb the peace of the dead. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano was the only one who was concerned about them. He bought them some furniture and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave them some money until Jose Arcadio recovered his sense of reality and began to work the no- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man&rsquo;s-land that bordered the courtyard of the house. Amaranta, on the other hand, never did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">overcome her rancor against Rebeca, even though life offered her a satisfaction of which she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not dreamed: at the initiative of Ursula, who did not know how to repair the shame, Pietro Crespi </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">continued having lunch at the house on Tuesdays, rising above his defeat with a serene dignity. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">still wore the black ribbon on his hat as a sign of respect for the family, and he took pleasure in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">showing his affection for Ursula by bringing her exotic gifts: Portuguese sardines, Turkish rose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marmalade, and on one occasion a lovely Manila shawl. Amaranta looked after him with a loving </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">diligence. She anticipated his wants, pulled out the threads on the cuffs of his shirt, and embroidered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a dozen handkerchiefs with his initials for his birthday. On Tuesdays, after lunch, while she would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">embroider on the porch, he would keep her happy company. For Pietro Crespi, that woman whom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he always had considered and treated as a child was a revelation. Although her temperament lacked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grace, she had a rare sensibility for appreciating the tilings of the world and had a secret tenderness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One Tuesday, when no one doubted that sooner or later it had to happen, Pietro Crespi asked her to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marry him. She did not stop her work. She waited for the hot blush to leave her ears and gave her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">voice a serene stress of maturity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, Crespi,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But when we know each other better. It&rsquo;s never good to be hasty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in things.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">51 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was confused. In spite of the esteem she had for Pietro Crespi, she could not tell whether </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his decision was good or bad from the moral point of view after his prolonged and famous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">engagement to Rebeca. But she finally accepted it as an unqualified fact because no one shared her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doubts. Aureliano, who was the man of the house, confused her further with his enigmatic and final </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opinion: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;These are not times to go around thinking about weddings.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That opinion, which Ursula understood only some months later, was the only sincere one that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano could express at that moment, not only with respect to marriage, but to anything that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not war. He himself, facing a firing squad, would not understand too well the concatenation of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">series of subtle but irrevocable accidents that brought him to that point. The death of Remedios had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not produced the despair that he had feared. It was, rather, a dull feeling of rage that grades ally </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dissolved in a solitary and passive frustration similar to the one he had felt during the time he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">resigned to living without a woman. He plunged into his work again, but he kept up the custom of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">playing dominoes with his father-in-law. In a house bound up in mourning, the nightly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conversations consolidated the friendship between the two men. &ldquo;Get married again. Aurelito,&rdquo; his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">father-in-law would tell him. &ldquo;I have six daughters for you to choose from.&rdquo; On one occasion on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote returned from one of his frequent trips worried about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the political situation in the country. The Liberals were determined to go to war. Since Aureliano at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that time had very confused notions about the difference between Conservatives and Liberals, his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">father-in-law gave him some schematic lessons. The Liberals, he said, were Freemasons, bad people, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanting to hang priests, to institute civil marriage and divorce, to recognize the rights of illegitimate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children as equal to those of legitimate ones, and to cut the country up into a federal system that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would take power away from the supreme authority. The Conservatives, on the other hand, who had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">received their power directly from God, proposed the establishment of public order and family </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morality. They were the defenders of the faith of Christ, of the principle of authority, and were not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prepared to permit the country to be broken down into autonomous entities. Because of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">humanitarian feelings Aureliano sympathized with the Liberal attitude with respect to the rights of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">natural children, but in any case, he could not understand how people arrived at the extreme of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waging war over things that could not be touched with the hand. It seemed an exaggeration to him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that for the elections his father-in-law had them send six soldiers armed with rifles under the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">command of a sergeant to a town with no political passions. They not only arrived, but they went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from house to house confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kitchen knives before they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distributed among males over twenty-one the blue ballots with the names of the Conservative </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">candidates and the red ballots with the names of the Liberal candidates. On the eve of the elections </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don Apolinar Moscote himself read a decree that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gathering together of more than three people who were not of the same family. The elections took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">place without incident. At eight o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning a wooden ballot box was set up in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">square, which was watched over by the six soldiers. The voting was absolutely free, as Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself was able to attest since he spent almost the entire day with his father-in-law seeing that no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one voted more than once. At four in the afternoon a roll of dmms in the square announced the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">closing of the polls and Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box with a label crossed by his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">signature. That night, while he played dominoes with Aureliano, he ordered the sergeant to break the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seal in order to count the votes. There were almost as many red ballots as blue, but the sergeant left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only ten red ones and made up the difference with blue ones. Then they sealed the box again with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">new label and the first thing on the following day it was taken to the capital of the province. &ldquo;The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Uberals will go to war,&rdquo; Aureliano said. Don Apolinar concentrated on his domino pieces. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saying that because of the switch in ballots, they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We left a few red ones in so there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">won&rsquo;t be any complaints.&rdquo; Aureliano understood the disadvantages of being in the opposition. &ldquo;If I </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">52 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were a Liberal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go to war because of those ballots.&rdquo; His father-in-law looked at him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over his glasses. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come now, Aurelito,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you were a Liberal, even though you&rsquo;re my son-in-law, you </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wouldn&rsquo;t have seen the switching of the ballots.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What really caused indignation in the town was. not the results of the elections but the fact that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the soldiers had not returned the weapons. A group of women spoke with Aureliano so that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could obtain the return of their kitchen knives from his father-in-law. Don Apolinar Moscote </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">explained to him, in strictest confidence, that the soldiers had taken the weapons off as proof that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Liberals were preparing for war. The cynicism of the remark alarmed him. He said nothing, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on a certain night when Gerineldo Marquez and Magnifico Visbal were speaking with some other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">friends about the incident of the knives, they asked him if he was a Liberal or a Conservative. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano did not hesitate. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I have to be something I&rsquo;ll be a Liberal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because the Conservatives are tricky.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the following day, at the urging of his friends, he went to see Dr. Alirio Noguera to be treated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for a supposed pain in his liver. He did not even understand the meaning of the subterfuge. Dr. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alirio Noguera had arrived in Macondo a few years before with a medicine chest of tasteless pills </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and a medical motto that convinced no one: One nail draws another. In reality he was a charlatan. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind his innocent facade of a doctor without prestige there was hidden a terrorist who with his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">short legged boots covered the scars that five years in the stocks had left on his legs. Taken prisoner </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">during the first federalist adventure, he managed to escape to Curasao disguised in the garment he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">detested most in this world: a cassock. At the end of a prolonged exile, stirred up by the exciting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">news that exiles from all over the Caribbean brought to Curasao, he set out in a smuggler&rsquo;s schooner </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and appeared in Riohacha with the bottles of pills that were nothing but refined sugar and a diploma </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the University of Leipzig that he had forged himself. He wept with disappointment. The fed&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eralist fervor, which the exiles had pictured as a powder keg about to explode, had dissolved into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vague electoral illusion. Embittered by failure, yearning for a safe place where he could await old age, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the false homeopath took refuge in Macondo. In the narrow bottle-crowded room that he rented on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one side of the square, he lived several years off the hopelessly ill who, after having tried everything, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consoled themselves with sugar pills. His instincts of an agitator remained dormant as long as Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apolinar Moscote was a figurehead. He passed the time remembering and fighting against asthma. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The approach of the elections was the thread that led him once more to the skein of subversion. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made contact with the young people in the town, who lacked political knowledge, and he embarked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on a stealthy campaign of instigation. The numerous red ballots that appeared is the box and that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were attributed by Don Apolinar Moscote to the curiosity that came from youth were part of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plan: he made his disciples vote in order to show them that elections were a farce. &ldquo;The only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">effective thing,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;is violence.&rdquo; The majority of Aureliano&rsquo;s friends were enthusiastic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over the idea of liquidating the Conservative establishment, but no one had dared include him in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plans, not only because of his ties with the magistrate, but because of his solitary and elusive </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">character. It was known, furthermore, that he had voted blue at his father-in-law&rsquo;s direction. So it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a simple matter of chance that he revealed his political sentiments, and it was purely a matter of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">curiosity, a caprice, that brought him to visit the doctor for the treatment of a pain that he did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have. In the den that smelled of camphorated cobwebs he found himself facing a kind of dusty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">iguana whose lungs whistled when he breathed. Before asking him any questions the doctor took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him to the window and examined the inside of his lower eyelid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there,&rdquo; Aureliano said, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">following what they told him. He pushed the tips of his fingers into his liver and added: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where I have the pain that won&rsquo;t let me sleep.&rdquo; Then Dr. Noguera closed the window with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pretext that there was too much sun, and explained to him in simple terms that it was a patriotic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">duty to assassinate Conservatives. For several days Aureliano carried a small bottle of pills in his </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">53 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shirt pocket. He would take it out every two hours, put three pills in the palm of his hand, and pop </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them into his mouth for them to be slowly dissolved on his tongue. Don Apolinar Moscote made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fun of Inis faith in homeopathy, but those who were in on the plot recognized another one of their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people in him. Almost all of the sons of the founders were implicated, although none of them knew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concretely what action they were plotting. Nevertheless, the day the doctor revealed the secret to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, the latter elicited the whole plan of the conspiracy. Although he was convinced at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time of the urgency of liquidating the Conservative regime, the plot horrified him. Dr. Noguera had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a mystique of personal assassination. His system was reduced to coordinating a series of individual </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">actions which in one master stroke covering the whole nation would liquidate the functionaries of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the regime along with their respective families, especially the children, in order to exterminate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conservatism at its roots. Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and his six daughters, needless to say, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were on the list. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no Liberal or anything else,&rdquo; Aureliano told him without getting excited. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but a butcher.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; the doctor replied with equal calm, &ldquo;give me back the bottle. You don&rsquo;t need it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">any more.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only six months later did Aureliano learn that the doctor had given up on him as a man of action </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because he was a sentimental person with no future, with a passive character, and a definite solitary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vocation. They tried to keep him surrounded, fearing that he would betray the conspiracy. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">calmed them down: he would not say a word, but on the night they went to murder the Moscote </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">family they would find him guarding the door. He showed such a convincing decision that the plan </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was postponed for an indefinite date. It was during those days that Ursula asked his opinion about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the marriage between Pietro Crespi and Amaranta, and he answered that these were not times to be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thinking about such a thing. For a week he had been carrying an old-fashioned pistol under his shirt. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He kept his eyes on his friends. In the afternoon he would go have coffee with Jose Arcadio and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca, who had begun to put their house in order, and from seven o&rsquo;clock on he would play </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dominoes with his father-in-law. At lunchtime he was chatting with Arcadio, who was already a huge </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">adolescent, and he found him more and more excited over the imminence of war. In school, where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio had pupils older than himself mixed in with children who were barely beginning to talk, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Uberal fever had caught on. There was talk of shooting Father Nicanor, of turning the church into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">school, of instituting free love. Aureliano tried to calm down his drive. He recommended discretion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and prudence to him. Deaf to his calm reasoning, to his sense of reality, Arcadio reproached him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">public for his weakness of character. Aureliano waited. Finally, in the beginning of December, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula burst into the workshop all upset. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;War&rsquo;s broken out!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">War, in fact, had broken out three months before. Martial law was in effect in the whole country. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only one who knew it immediately was Don Apolinar Moscote, but he did not give the news </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even to his wife while the army platoon that was to occupy the town by surprise was on its way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They entered noiselessly before dawn, with two pieces of light artillery drawn by mules, and they set </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up their headquarters in the school. A 6 p.m. curfew was established. A more drastic search than the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">previous one was undertaken, house by house, and this time they even took farm implements. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dragged out Dr. Noguera, tied him to a tree in the square, and shot him without any due process of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">law. Father Nicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the miracle of levitation and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his head split open by the butt of a soldier&rsquo;s rifle. The Liberal exaltation had been extinguished into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">silent terror. Aureliano, pale, mysterious, continued playing dominoes with his father-in-law. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understood that in spite of his present title of civil and military leader of the town, Don Apolinar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moscote was once more a figurehead. The decisions were made by the army captain, who each </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morning collected an extraordinary levy for the defense of public order. Four soldiers under his </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">54 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">command snatched a woman who had been bitten by a mad dog from her family and killed her with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their rifle butts. One Sunday, two weeks after the occupation, Aureliano entered Gerineldo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marquez&rsquo;s house and with his usual terseness asked for a mug of coffee without sugar. When the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two of them were alone in the kitchen, Aureliano gave his voice an authority that had never been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heard before. &ldquo;Get the boys ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to war.&rdquo; Gerineldo Marquez did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">believe him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With what weapons?&rdquo; he asked. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With theirs,&rdquo; Aureliano replied. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday at midnight in a mad operation, twenty-one men under the age of thirty commanded by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia, armed with table knives and sharpened tools, took the garrison by surprise, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seized the weapons, and in the courtyard executed the captain and the four soldiers who had lulled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the woman. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That same night, while the sound of the firing squad could be heard, Arcadio was named civil </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and military leader of the town. The married rebels barely had time to take leave of their wives, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whom they left to their our devices. They left at dawn, cheered by the people who had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">liberated from the terror, to join the forces of the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, who, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">according to the latest reports, was on his way to Manaure. Before leaving, Aureliano brought Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apolinar Moscote out of a closet. &ldquo;Rest easy, father-in-law,&rdquo; he told him. &ldquo;The new government </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">guarantees on its word of honor your personal safety and that of your family.&rdquo; Don Apolinar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moscote had trouble identifying that conspirator in high boots and with a rifle slung over his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shoulder with the person he had played dominoes with until nine in the evening. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is madness, Aurelito,&rdquo; he exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not madness,&rdquo; Aureliano said. &ldquo;War. And don&rsquo;t call me Aurelito any more. Now I&rsquo;m Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">55 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 6 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">COLONEL AURELIANO BUENDIA organized thirty-two armed uprisings and he lost them all. He had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seventeen male children by seventeen different women and they were exterminated one after the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other on a single night before the oldest one had reached the age of thirty-five. He survived fourteen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attempts on his life, seventy-three ambushes, and a firing squad. He lived through a dose of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strychnine in his coffee that was enough to kill a horse. He refused the Order of Merit, which the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">President of the Republic awarded him. He rose to be Commander in Chief of the revolutionary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forces, with jurisdiction and command from one border to the other, and the man most feared by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the government, but he never let himself be photographed. He declined the lifetime pension offered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him after the war and until old age he made his living from the little gold fishes that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manufactured in his workshop in Macondo. Although he always fought at the head of his men, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only wound that he received was the one he gave himself after signing the Treaty of Neerlandia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which put an end to almost twenty years of civil war. He shot himself in the chest with a pistol and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bullet came out through his back without damaging any vital organ. The only thing left of all that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a street that bore his name in Macondo. And yet, as he declared a few years before he died of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">old age, he had not expected any of that on the dawn he left with his twenty-one men to join the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forces of General Victorio Medina. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We leave Macondo in your care.&rdquo; was all that he said to Arcadio before leaving. &ldquo;We leave it to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you in good shape, try to have it in better shape when we return.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio gave a very personal interpretation to the instructions. He invented a uniform with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">braid and epaulets of a marshal, inspired by the prints in one of Melquiades&rsquo; books, and around his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waist he buckled the saber with gold tassels that had belonged to the executed captain. He set up the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two artillery pieces at the entrance to town, put uniforms on his former pupils, who had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">amused by his fiery proclamations, and let them wander through the streets armed in order to give </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">outsiders an impression of invulnerability. It was a double-edged deception, for the government did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not dare attack the place for ten months, but when it did it unleashed such a large force against it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that resistance was liquidated in a half hour. From the first day of his rule Arcadio revealed his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">predilection for decrees. He would read as many as four a day in order to decree and institute </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything that came into his head. He imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">declared to be public property any animals walking the streets after six in the evening, and made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">men who were overage wear red armbands. He sequestered Father Nicanor in the parish house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">under pain of execution and prohibited him from saying mass or ringing the bells unless it was for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Liberal victory. In order that no one would doubt the severity of his aims, he ordered a firing squad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">organized in the square and had it shoot at a scarecrow. At first no one took him seriously. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were, after all, schoolchildren playing at being grown-ups. But one night, when Arcadio went into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Catarino&rsquo;s store, the trumpeter in the group greeted him with a fanfare that made the customers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laugh and Arcadio had him shot for disrespect for the authorities. People who protested were put on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bread and water with their ankles in a set of stocks that he had set up in a schoolroom. &ldquo;You </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">murderer!&rdquo; Ursula would shout at him every time she learned of some new arbitrary act. &ldquo;When </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano finds out he&rsquo;s going to shoot you and I&rsquo;ll be the first one to be glad.&rdquo; But it was of no use. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio continued tightening the tourniquet with unnecessary rigor until he became the cmelest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mler that Macondo had ever known. &ldquo;Now let them suffer the difference,&rdquo; Don Apolinar Moscote </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said on one occasion. &ldquo;This is the Liberal paradise.&rdquo; Arcadio found out about it. At the head of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patrol he assaulted the house, destroyed the furniture, flogged the daughters, and dragged out Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apolinar Moscote. When Ursula burst into the courtyard of headquarters, after having gone through </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">56 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the town shouting shame and brandishing with rage a pitch-covered whip, Arcadio himself was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">preparing to give the squad the command to fire. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I dare you to, bastard!&rdquo; Ursula shouted. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Arcadio had time to read she let go with the first blow of the lash. &ldquo;I dare you to, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">murderer!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;And kill me too, son of an evil mother. That way I won&rsquo;t have the eyes to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weep for the shame of having raised a monster.&rdquo; Whipping him without mercy, she chased him to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the back of the courtyard, where Arcadio curled up like a snail in its shell. Don Apolinar Moscote </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was unconscious, tied to the post where previously they had had the scarecrow that had been cut to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pieces by shots fired in fun. The boys in the squad scattered, fearful that Ursula would go after them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">too. But she did not even look at them. She left Arcadio with Inis uniform torn, roaring with pain </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and rage, and she untied Don Apolinar Moscote and took him home. Before leaving the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">headquarters she released the prisoners from the stocks. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that time on she was the one who ruled in the town. She reestablished Sunday masses, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suspended the use of red armbands, and abrogated the harebrained decrees. But in spite of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strength, she still wept over her unfortunate fate. She felt so much alone that she sought the useless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">company of her husband, who had been forgotten under the chestnut tree. &ldquo;Look what we&rsquo;ve come </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to,&rdquo; she would tell him as the June rains threatened to knock the shelter down. &ldquo;Look at the empty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house, our children scattered all over the world, and the two of us alone again, the same as in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beginning.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Buendia, sunk in an abyss of unawareness, was deaf to her lamentations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the beginning of his madness he would announce his daily needs with urgent Latin phrases. In </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fleeting clear spells of lucidity, when Amaranta would bring him his meals he would tell her what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bothered him most and would accept her sucking glasses and mustard plasters in a docile way. But at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the time when Ursula went to lament by his side he had lost all contact with reality. She would bathe </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him bit by bit as he sat on his stool while she gave him news of the family. &ldquo;Aureliano went to war </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more than four months ago and we haven&rsquo;t heard anything about him,&rdquo; she would say, scrubbing his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back with a soaped brush. &ldquo;Jose Arcadio came back a big man, taller than you, and all covered with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">needle-work, but he only brought shame to our house.&rdquo; She thought she noticed, however, that her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband would grow sad with the bad news. Then she decided to lie to him. &lsquo;Rou won&rsquo;t believe </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what I&rsquo;m going to tell you,&rdquo; she said as she threw ashes over his excrement in order to pick it up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the shovel. &ldquo;God willed that Jose Arcadio and Rebeca should get married, and now they&rsquo;re very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">happy.&rdquo; She got to be so sincere in the deception that she ended up by consoling herself with her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">own lies. &ldquo;Arcadio is a serious man now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and very brave, and a fine-looking young man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with his uniform and saber.&rdquo; It was like speaking to a dead man, for Jose Arcadio Buendia was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">already beyond the reach of any worry. But she insisted. He seemed so peaceful, so indifferent to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything that she decided to release him. He did not even move from his stool. He stayed there, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exposed to the sun and the rain, as if the thongs were unnecessary, for a dominion superior to any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">visible bond kept him tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree. Toward August, when winter began to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">last forever, Ursula was finally able to give him a piece of news that sounded like the truth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Would you believe it that good luck is still pouring down on us?&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Amaranta and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the pianola Italian are going to get married.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta and Pietro Crespi had, in fact, deepened their friendship, protected by Ursula, who this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time did not think it necessary to watch over the visits. It was a twilight engagement. The Italian </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would arrive at dusk, with a gardenia in his buttonhole, and he would translate Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnets for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta. They would sit on the porch, suffocated by the oregano and the roses, he reading and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sewing lace cuffs, indifferent to the shocks and bad news of the war, until the mosquitoes made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them take refuge in the parlor. Amaranta&rsquo;s sensibility, her discreet but enveloping tenderness had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been wearing an invisible web about her fiance, which he had to push aside materially with his pale </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and ringless fingers in order to leave the house at eight o&rsquo;clock. They had put together a delightful </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">57 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">album with the postcards that Pietro Crespi received from Italy. They were pictures of lovers in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lonely parks, with vignettes of hearts pierced with arrows and golden ribbons held by doves. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been to this park in Florence,&rdquo; Pietro Crespi would say, going through the cards. &ldquo;A person can put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out his hand and the birds will come to feed.&rdquo; Sometimes, over a watercolor of Venice, nostalgia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would transform the smell of mud and putrefying shellfish of the canals into the warm aroma of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flowers. Amaranta would sigh, laugh, and dream of a second homeland of handsome men and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beautiful women who spoke a childlike language with ancient cities of whose past grandeur only the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cats among the mbble remained. After crossing the ocean in search of it, after having confused </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passion with the vehement stroking of Rebeca, Pietro Crespi had found love. Happiness was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accompanied by prosperity. His warehouse at that time occupied almost a whole block and it was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hothouse of fantasy, with reproductions of the bell tower of Florence that told time with a concert </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of carillons, and music boxes from Sorrento and compacts from China that sang five-note melodies </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when they were opened, and all the musical instmments imaginable and all the mechanical toys that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could be conceived. Bmno Crespi, his younger brother, was in charge of the store because Pietro </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Crespi barely had enough time to take care of the music school. Thanks to him the Street of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turks, with its dazzling display of knickknacks, became a melodic oasis where one could forget </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio&rsquo;s arbitrary acts and the distant nightmare of the war. When Ursula ordered the revival of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday mass, Pietro Crespi donated a German harmonium to the church, organized a children&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chorus, and prepared a Gregorian repertory that added a note of splendor to Father Nicanor&rsquo;s quiet </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rite. No one doubted that he would make Amaranta a fortunate mate. Not pushing their feelings, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letting themselves be borne along by the natural flow of their hearth they reached a point where all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was left to do was set a wedding date. They did not encounter any obstacles. Ursula accused </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">herself inwardly of having twisted Rebecca&rsquo;s destiny with repeated postponements and she was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about to add more remorse. The rigor of the mourning for Remedios had been relegated to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">background by the mortifications of the war, Aureliano&rsquo;s absence, Arcadio&rsquo;s brutality, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expulsion of Jose Arcadio and Rebeca. With the imminence of the wedding, Pietro Crespi had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hinted that Aureliano Jose, in whom he had stirred up a love that was almost filial, would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">considered their oldest child. Everything made Amaranta think that she was heading toward a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">smooth happiness. But unlike Rebeca, she did not reveal the slightest anxiety. With the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patience with which she dyed tablecloths, sewed lace masterpieces, and embroidered needlepoint </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">peacocks, she waited for Pietro Crespi to be unable to bear the urges of his heart and more. Her day </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came with the ill-fated October rains. Pietro Crespi took the sewing basket from her lap and he told </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get married next month.&rdquo; Amaranta did not tremble at the contact with his icy hands. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She withdrew hers like a timid little animal and went back to her work. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be simple, Crespi.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t marry you even if I were dead.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pietro Crespi lost control of himself. He wept shamelessly, almost breaking his fingers with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">desperation, but he could not break her down. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your time,&rdquo; was all that Amaranta said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you really love me so much, don&rsquo;t set foot in this house again.&rdquo; Ursula thought she would go </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mad with shame. Pietro Crespi exhausted all manner of pleas. He went through incredible extremes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of humiliation. He wept one whole afternoon in Ursula&rsquo;s lap and she would have sold her soul in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">order to comfort him. On rainy nights he could be seen prowling about the house with an umbrella, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting for a light in Amaranta&rsquo;s bedroom. He was never better dressed than at that time. His august </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">head of a tormented emperor had acquired a strange air of grandeur. He begged Amaranta&rsquo;s friends, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the ones who sewed with her on the porch, to try to persuade her. He neglected his business. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would spend the day in the rear of the store writing wild notes, which he would send to Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with flower petals and dried butterflies, and which she would return unopened. He would shut </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself up for hours on end to play the zither. One night he sang. Macondo woke up in a kind of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">angelic stupor that was caused by a zither that deserved more than this world and a voice that led </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">58 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one to believe that no other person on earth could feel such love. Pietro Crespi then saw the lights </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">go on in every window in town except that of Amaranta. On November second, All Souls&rsquo; Day, his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brother opened the store and found all the lamps lighted, all the music boxes opened, and all the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">docks striking an interminable hour, and in the midst of that mad concert he found Pietro Crespi at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the desk in the rear with his wrists cut by a razor and his hands thrust into a basin of benzoin. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula decreed that the wake would be in her house. Father Nicanor was against a religious </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ceremony and burial in consecrated ground. Ursula stood up to him. &ldquo;In a way that neither you nor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can understand, that man was a saint,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So I am going to bury him, against your wishes, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beside Melquiades&rsquo; grave.&rdquo; She did it with the support of the whole town and with a magnificent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">funeral. Amaranta did not leave her bedroom. From her bed she heard Ursula&rsquo;s weeping, the steps </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and whispers of the multitude that invaded the house, the wailing of the mourners, and then a deep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">silence that smelled of trampled flowers. For a long time she kept on smelling Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lavender breath at dusk, but she had the strength not to succumb to delirium. Ursula abandoned her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did not even raise her eyes to pity her on the afternoon when Amaranta went into the kitchen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and put her hand into the coals of the stove until it hurt her so much that she felt no more pain but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">instead smelled the pestilence of her own singed flesh. It was a stupid cure for her remorse. For </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">several days she went about the house with her hand in a pot of egg whites, and when the burns </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">healed it appeared as if the whites had also scarred over the sores on her heart. The only external </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trace that the tragedy left was the bandage of black gauze that she put on her burned hand and that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she wore until her death. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio gave a rare display of generosity by decreeing official mourning for Pietro Crespi. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interpreted it as the return of the strayed lamb. But she was mistaken. She had lost Arcadio, not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he had put on his military uniform, but from the beginning. She thought she had raised him as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a son, as she had raised Rebeca, with no privileges or discrimination. Nevertheless, Arcadio was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitary and frightened child during the insomnia plague, in the midst of Ursula&rsquo;s utilitarian fervor, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">during the delirium of Jose Arcadio Buendfa, the hermetism of Aureliano, and the mortal rivalry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">between Amaranta and Rebeca. Aureliano had taught him to read and write, thinking about other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">things, as he would have done with a stranger. He gave him his clothing so that Visitacion could take </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it in when it was ready to be thrown away. Arcadio suffered from shoes that were too large, from his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patched pants, from his female buttocks. He never succeeded in communicating with anyone better </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than he did with Visitacion and Cataure in their language. Melquiades was the only one who really </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was concerned with him as he made him listen to his incomprehensible texts and gave him lessons </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the art of daguerreotype. No one imagined how much he wept in secret and the desperation with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which he tried to revive Melquiades with the useless study of his papers. The school, where they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">paid attention to him and respected him, and then power, with his endless decrees and his glorious </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">uniform, freed him from the weight of an old bitterness. One night in Catarino&rsquo;s store someone </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dared tell him, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t deserve the last name you carry.&rdquo; Contrary to what everyone expected, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio did not have him shot. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To my great honor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not a Buendia.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who knew the secret of his parentage thought that the answer meant that he too was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">aware of it, but he had really never been. Pilar Ternera, his mother, who had made his blood boil in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the darkroom, was as much an irresistible obsession for him as she had been first for Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and then for Aureliano. In spite of her having lost her charms and the splendor of her laugh, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sought her out and found her by the trail of her smell of smoke. A short time before the war, one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">noon when she was later than usual in coming for her younger son at school, Arcadio was waiting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for her in the room where he was accustomed to take his siesta and where he later set up the stocks. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the child played in the courtyard, he waited in his hammock, trembling with anxiety, knowing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Pillar Ternera would have to pass through there. She arrived. Arcadio grabbed her by the wrist </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">59 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and tried to pull her into the hammock. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Pilar Ternera said in horror. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">imagine how much I would like to make you happy, but as God is my witness I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Arcadio took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her by the waist with his tremendous hereditary strength and he felt the world disappear with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contact of her skin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the saint,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After all, everybody knows that you&rsquo;re a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whore.&rdquo; Pilar overcame the disgust that her miserable fate inspired in her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The children will find out,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It will be better if you leave the bar off the door </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tonight.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio waited for her that night trembling with fever in his hammock. He waited without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sleeping, listening to the aroused crickets in the endless hours of early morning and the implacable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">telling of time by the curlews, more and more convinced that he had been deceived. Suddenly, when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anxiety had broken down into rage, the door opened. A few months later, facing the firing squad, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio would relive the wandering steps in the classroom, the stumbling against benches, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finally the bulk of a body in the shadows of the room and the breathing of air that was pumped by a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heart that was not his. He stretched out his hand and found another hand with two rings on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same finger about to go astray in the darkness. He felt the structure of the veins, the pulse of its </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">misfortune, and felt the damp palm with a lifeline cut off at the base of the thumb by the claws of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death. Then he realized that this was not the woman he was waiting for, because she did not smell of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">smoke but of flower lotion, and she had inflated, blind breasts with nipples like, a man&rsquo;s, a sex as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stony and round as a nut, and the chaotic tenderness of excited inexperience. She was a virgin and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had the unlikely name of Santa Sofia de la Piedad. Pilar Ternera had paid her fifty pesos, half of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her life savings, to do what she was doing. Arcadio, had seen her many times working in her parents&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">small food store but he had never taken a good look at her because she had that rare virtue of never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">existing completely except at the opportune moment. But from that day on he huddled like a cat in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the warmth of her armpit She would go to the school at siesta time with the consent of her parents, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to whom Pilar Ternera hid paid the other half of her savings. Later on, when the government troops </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dislodged them from the place where they had made love, they did it among the cans of lard and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sacks of corn in the back of the store. About the time that Arcadio was named civil and military </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leader they had a daughter. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only relatives who knew about it were Jose Arcadio and Rebeca, with whom Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">maintained close relations at that time, based not so much on kinship as on complicity. Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had put his neck into the marital yoke. Rebeca&rsquo;s firm character, the voracity of her stomach, her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tenacious ambition absorbed the tremendous energy of her husband, who had been changed from a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lazy, woman-chasing man into an enormous work animal. They kept a clean and neat house. Rebeca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would open it wide at dawn and the wind from the graveyard would come in through the windows </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and go out through the doors to the yard and leave the whitewashed walls and furniture tanned by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the saltpeter of the dead. Her hunger for earth, the cloc-cloc of her parents&rsquo; bones, the impatience of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her blood as it faced Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s passivity were relegated to the attic of her memory. All day long </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she would embroider beside the window, withdrawn from the uneasiness of the war, until the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ceramic pots would begin to vibrate in the cupboard and she would get up to warm the meal, much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before the appearance, first, of the mangy hounds, and then of the colossus in leggings and spurs </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a double-barreled shotgun, who sometimes carried a deer on his shoulder and almost always a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">string of rabbits or wild ducks. One afternoon, at the beginning of his rule, Arcadio paid them a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surprise visit. They had not seen him since they had left the house, but he seemed so friendly and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">familiar that they invited him to share the stew. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only when they were having coffee did Arcadio reveal the motive behind his visit: he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">received a complaint against Jose Arcadio. It was said that he had begun by plowing his own yard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and had gone straight ahead into neighboring lands, knocking down fences and buildings with his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">oxen until he took forcible possession of the best plots of land around. On the peasants whom he </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">60 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not despoiled because he was not interested in their lands, he levied a contribution which he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">collected every Saturday with his hunting dogs and his double-barreled shotgun. He did not deny it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He based his right on the fact that the usurped lands had been distributed by Jose Arcadio Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at the time of the founding, and he thought it possible to prove that his father had been crazy ever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since that time, for he had disposed of a patrimony that really belonged to the family. It was an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unnecessary allegation, because Arcadio had not come to do justice. He simply offered to set up a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">registry office so that Jose Arcadio could legalize his title to the usurped land, under the condition </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he delegate to the local government the right to collect the contributions. They made an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">agreement. Years later, when Colonel Aureliano Buendia examined the titles to property, he found </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">registered in his brother&rsquo;s name all of the land between the hill where his yard was on up to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">horizon, including the cemetery, and discovered that during the eleven months of his rule, Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had collected not only the money of the contributions, but had also collected fees from people for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the right to bury their dead in Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s land. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took Ursula several months to find out what was already public knowledge because people hid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it from her so as not to increase her suffering. At first she suspected it. &ldquo;Arcadio is building a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house,&rdquo; she confided with feigned pride to her husband as she tried to put a spoonful of calabash </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">syrup into his mouth. Nevertheless, she involuntarily sighed and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, but all this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">has a bad smell to me.&rdquo; Later on, when she found out that Arcadio had not only built a house but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had ordered some Viennese furniture, she confirmed her suspicion that he was using public funds. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the shame of our family name,&rdquo; she shouted at him one Sunday after mass when she saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him in his new house playing cards with his officers. Arcadio paid no attention to her. Only then did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula know that he had a six-month-old daughter and that Santa Sofia de la Piedad, with whom he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was living outside of marriage, was pregnant again. She decided to write to Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia, wherever he was, to bring him up to date on the situation. But the fast-moving events of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those days not only prevented her plans from being carried out, they made her regret having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conceived them. The war, which until then had been only a word to designate a vague and remote </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">circumstance, became a concrete and dramatic reality. Around the end of February an old woman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with an ashen look arrived in Macondo riding a donkey loaded down with brooms. She seemed so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inoffensive that the sentries let her pass without any questions as another vendor, one of the many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who often arrived from the towns in the swamp. She went directly to the barracks. Arcadio received </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her in the place where the classroom used to be and which at that time had been transformed into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kind of rearguard encampment, with roiled hammocks hanging on hooks and mats piled up in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">corners, and rifles and carbines and even hunting shotguns scattered on the floor. The old woman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stiffened into a military salute before identifying herself: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am Colonel Gregorio Stevenson.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He brought bad news. The last centers of Liberal resistance, according to what he said, were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being wiped out. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, whom he had left fighting in retreat near Riohacha, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had given him a message for Arcadio. He should surrender the town without resistance on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">condition that the lives and property of Liberals would be respected. Arcadio examined that strange </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">messenger who could have been a fugitive grandmother with a look of pity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have brought something in writing, naturally,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; the emissary answered, &ldquo;I have brought nothing of the sort. It&rsquo;s easy to understand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that under the present circumstances a person can&rsquo;t carry anything that would compromise him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he was speaking he reached into his bodice and took out a small gold fish. &ldquo;I think that this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">will be sufficient,&rdquo; he said. Arcadio could see that indeed it was one of the little fishes made by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia. But anyone could have bought it before the war or stolen it, and it had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no merit as a safe-conduct pass. The messenger even went to the extreme of violating a military </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secret so that they would believe his identity. He revealed that he was on a mission to Curasao, </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">61 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where he hoped to recruit exiles from all over the Caribbean and acquire arms and supplies </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sufficient to attempt a landing at the end of the year. With faith in that plan. Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia was not in favor of any useless sacrifices at that time. But Arcadio was inflexible. He had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the prisoner put into the stocks until he could prove his identity and he resolved to defend the town </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the death. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not have long to wait. The news of the Liberal defeat was more and more concrete. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Toward the end of March, before a dawn of premature rain, the tense calm of the previous weeks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was abruptly broken by the desperate sounds of a cornet and a cannon shot that knocked down the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">steeple of the church. Actually, Arcadio&rsquo;s decision to resist was madness. He had only fifty poorly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armed men with a ration of twenty cartridges apiece. But among them, his former pupils, excited by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the high-sounding proclamations, the determination reigned to sacrifice their skins for a lost cause. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the midst of the tramping of boots, contradictory commands, cannon shots that made the earth </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tremble, wild shooting, and the senseless sound of cornets, the supposed Colonel Stevenson </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">managed to speak to Arcadio. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me undergo the indignity of dying in the stocks in these </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">women&rsquo;s clothes,&rdquo; he said to him. &ldquo;If I have to die, let me die fighting.&rdquo; He succeeded in convincing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him. Arcadio ordered them to give him a weapon and twenty cartridges, and he left him with five </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">men to defend headquarters while he went off with his staff to head up the resistance. He did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">get to the road to the swamp. The barricades had been broken and the defenders were openly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fighting in the streets, first until they used up their ration of rifle bullets, then with pistols against </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rifles, and finally hand to hand. With the imminence of defeat, some women went into the street </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armed with sticks and kitchen knives. In that confusion Arcadio found Amaranta, who was looking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for him like a madwoman, in her nightgown and with two old pistols that had belonged to Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia. He gave his rifle to an officer who had been disarmed in the fight and escaped </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with Amaranta through a nearby street to take her home. Ursula was, in the doorway waiting, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">indifferent to the cannon shots that had opened up a hole in the front of the house next door. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rain was letting up, but the streets were as slippery and as smooth as melted soap, and one had to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">guess distances in the darkness. Arcadio left Amaranta with Ursula and made an attempt to face two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soldiers who had opened up with heavy firing from the corner. The old pistols that had been kept </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for many years in the bureau did not work. Protecting Arcadio with her body, Ursula tried to drag </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him toward the house. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come along in the name of God,&rdquo; she shouted at him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been enough madness!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers aimed at them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let go of that man, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; one of them shouted, &ldquo;or we won&rsquo;t be responsible!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio pushed Ursula toward the house and surrendered. A short time later the shooting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stopped and the bells began to toll. The resistance had been wiped out in less than half an hour. Not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a single one of Arcadio&rsquo;s men had survived the attack, but before dying they had killed three </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred soldiers. The last stronghold was the barracks. Before being attacked, the supposed Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gregorio Stevenson had freed the prisoners and ordered his men to go out and fight in the street. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The extraordinary mobility and accurate aim with which he placed his twenty cartridges gave the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impression that the barracks was well-defended, and the attackers blew it to pieces with cannon fire. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The captain who directed the operation was startled to find the rubble deserted and a single dead </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man in his undershorts with an empty rifle still clutched in an arm that had been blown completely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off. He had a woman&rsquo;s full head of hair held at the neck with a comb and on his neck a chain with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">small gold fish. When he turned him over with the tip of his boot and put the light on his face, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">captain was perplexed. &ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; he exclaimed. Other officers came over. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look where this fellow turned up,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gregorio Stevenson.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At dawn, after a summary court martial, Arcadio was shot against the wall of the cemetery. In the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">last two hours of his life he did not manage to understand why the fear that had tormented him </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">62 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since childhood had disappeared. Impassive, without even worrying about making a show of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recent bravery, he listened to the interminable charges of the accusation. He thought about Ursula, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who at that hour must have been under the chestnut tree having coffee with Jose Arcadio Buendia. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought about his eight-month-old daughter, who still had no name, and about the child who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was going to be born in August. He thought about Santa Sofia de la Piedad, whom he had left the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night before salting down a deer for next day&rsquo;s lunch, and he missed her hair pouring over her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shoulders and her eyelashes, which looked as if they were artificial. He thought about his people </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without sentimentality, with a strict dosing of his accounts with life, beginning to understand how </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much he really loved the people he hated most. The president of the court-martial began his final </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">speech when Arcadio realized that two hours had passed. &ldquo;Even if the proven charges did not have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">merit enough,&rdquo; the president was saying, &ldquo;the irresponsible and criminal boldness with which the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accused drove his subordinates on to a useless death would be enough to deserve capital </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">punishment.&rdquo; In the shattered schoolhouse where for the first time he had felt the security of power, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a few feet from the room where he had come to know the uncertainty of love, Arcadio found the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">formality of death ridiculous. Death really did not matter to him but life did, and therefore the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sensation he felt when they gave their decision was not a feeling of fear but of nostalgia. He did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">speak until they asked him for his last request. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell my wife,&rdquo; he answered in a well-modulated voice, &ldquo;to give the girl the name of Ursula.&rdquo; He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">paused and said it again: &ldquo;Ursula, like her grandmother. And tell her also that if the child that is to be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">born is a boy, they should name him Jose Arcadio, not for his uncle, but for his grandfather.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before they took him to the execution wall Father Nicanor tried to attend him. &ldquo;I have nothing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to repent,&rdquo; Arcadio said, and he put himself under the orders of the squad after drinking a cup of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">black coffee. The leader of the squad, a specialist in summary executions, had a name that had much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more about it than chance: Captain Roque Carnicero, which meant butcher. On the way to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cemetery, under the persistent drizzle, Arcadio saw that a radiant Wednesday was breaking out on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the horizon. His nostalgia disappeared with the mist and left an immense curiosity in its place. Only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when they ordered him to put his back to the wall did Arcadio see Rebeca, with wet hair and a pink </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flowered dress, opening wide the door. He made an effort to get her to recognize him. And Rebeca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did take a casual look toward the wall and was paralyzed with stupor, barely able to react and wave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">good-bye to Arcadio. Arcadio answered her the same way. At that instant the smoking mouths of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the rifles were aimed at him and letter by letter he heard the encyclicals that Melquiades had chanted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he heard the lost steps of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, a virgin, in the classroom, and in his nose he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">felt the same icy hardness that had drawn his attention in the nostrils of the corpse of Remedios. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, God damn it!&rdquo; he managed to think. &ldquo;I forgot to say that if it was a girl they should name her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios.&rdquo; Then, all accumulated in the rip of a claw, he felt again all the terror that had tormented </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him in his life. The captain gave the order to fire. Arcadio barely had time to put out his chest and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">raise his head, not understanding where the hot liquid that burned his thighs was pouring from. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bastards!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Long live the Liberal Party!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">63 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 7 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE WAR was over in May. Two weeks before the government made the official announcement in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">high-sounding proclamation, which promised merciless punishment for those who had started the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rebellion, Colonel Aureliano Buendia fell prisoner just as he was about to reach the western frontier </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disguised as an Indian witch doctor. Of the twenty-one men who had followed him to war, fourteen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fell in combat, six were wounded, and only one accompanied him at the moment of final defeat: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. The news of his capture was announced in Macondo with a special </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proclamation. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; Ursula told her husband. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pray to God for his enemies to show </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him clemency.&rdquo; After three days of weeping, one afternoon as she was stirring some sweet milk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">candy in the kitchen she heard her son&rsquo;s voice clearly in her ear. &ldquo;It was Aureliano, &ldquo; she shouted, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mnning toward the chestnut tree to tell her husband the news. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the miracle took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">place, but he&rsquo;s alive and we&rsquo;re going to see him very soon.&rdquo; She took it for granted. She had the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">floors of the house scmbbed and changed the position of the furniture. One week later a rumor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from somewhere that was not supported by any proclamation gave dramatic confirmation to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prediction. Colonel Aureliano Buendia had been condemned to death and the sentence would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carried out in Macondo as a lesson to the population. On Monday, at ten-thirty in the morning, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta was dressing Aureliano Jose when she heard the sound of a distant troop and the blast of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a cornet one second before Ursula burst into the room with the shout: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re bringing him now!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The troop struggled to subdue the overflowing crowd with their rifle butts. Ursula and Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ran to the corner, pushing their way through, and then they saw him. He looked like a beggar. His </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clothing was torn, his hair and beard were tangled, and he was barefoot. He was walking without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feeling the burning dust, his hands tied behind his back with a rope that a mounted officer had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attached to the head of his horse. Along with him, also ragged and defeated, they were bringing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. They were not sad. They seemed more disturbed by the crowd that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shouting all lands of insults at the troops. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My son!&rdquo; Ursula shouted in the midst of the uproar, and she slapped the soldier who tried to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hold her back. The officer&rsquo;s horse reared. Then Colonel Aureliano Buendia stopped, tremulous, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">avoided the arms of his mother, and fixed a stern look on her eyes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go home, Mama,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get permission from the authorities to come see me in jail.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked at Amaranta, who stood indecisively two steps behind Ursula, and he smiled as he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked her, &ldquo;What happened to your hand?&rdquo; Amaranta raised the hand with the black bandage. &ldquo;A </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burn,&rdquo; she said, and took Ursula away so that the horses would not run her down. The troop took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off. A special guard surrounded the prisoners and took them to the jail at a trot. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At dusk Ursula visited Colonel Aureliano Buendia in jail. She had tried to get permission through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don Apolinar Moscote, but he had lost all authority in the face of the military omnipotence. Father </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicanor was in bed with hepatic fever. The parents of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, who had not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been condemned to death, had tried to see him and were driven off with rifle butts. Facing the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impossibility of finding anyone to intervene, convinced that her son would be shot at dawn, Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrapped up the tilings she wanted to bring him and went to the jail alone. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendia,&rdquo; she announced. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sentries blocked her way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in in any case,&rdquo; Ursula warned them. &ldquo;So if you have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">orders to shoot, start right in.&rdquo; She pushed one of them aside and went into the former classroom, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where a group of half-dressed soldiers were oiling their weapons. An officer in a field uniform, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ruddy-faced, with very thick glasses and ceremonious manners, signaled to the sentries to withdraw. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendia,&rdquo; Ursula repeated. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">64 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You must mean,&rdquo; the officer corrected with a friendly smile, &ldquo;that you are the mother of Mister </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia.&rdquo; Ursula recognized in his affected way of speaking the languid cadence of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stuck-up people from the highlands. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As you say, mister&bull;&rdquo; she accepted, &ldquo;just as long as I can see him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were superior orders that prohibited visits to prisoners condemned to death, but the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officer assumed the responsibility of letting her have a fifteen-minute stay. Ursula showed him what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had in the bundle: a change of clean clothing, the short boots that her son had worn at his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding, and the sweet milk candy that she had kept for him since the day she had sensed his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">return. She found Colonel Aureliano Buendia in the room that was used as a cell, lying on a cot with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his arms spread out because his armpits were paved with sores. They had allowed him to shave. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thick mustache with twisted ends accentuated the sharp angles of his cheekbones. He looked paler </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to Ursula than when he had left, a little taller, and more solitary than ever. He knew all about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">details of the house: Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s suicide, Arcadio&rsquo;s arbitrary acts and execution, the dauntlessness </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Jose Arcadio Buendia underneath the chestnut tree. He knew that Amaranta had consecrated her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">virginal widowhood to the rearing of Aureliano Jose and that the latter was beginning to show signs </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of quite good judgment and that he had learned to read and write at the same time he had learned to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">speak. From the moment In which she entered the room Ursula felt inhibited by the maturity of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">son, by his aura of command, by the glow of authority that radiated from his skin. She was surprised </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he was so well-informed. &ldquo;You knew all along that I was a wizard,&rdquo; he joked. And he added in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">serious tone, &ldquo;This morning, when they brought me here, I had the impression that I had already </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been through all that before.&rdquo; In fact, while the crowd was roaring alongside him, he had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concentrating his thoughts, startled at how the town had aged. The leaves of the almond trees were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">broken. The houses, painted blue, then painted red, had ended up with an indefinable coloration. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo; Ursula sighed. &ldquo;Time passes.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it goes,&rdquo; Aureliano admitted, &ldquo;but not so much.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that way the long-awaited visit, for which both had prepared questions and had even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anticipated answers, was once more the usual everyday conversation. When the guard announced </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the end of the visit, Aureliano took out a roll of sweaty papers from under the cot. They were his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">poetry, the poems inspired by Remedios, which he had taken with him when he left, and those he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had written later on during chance pauses in the war. &ldquo;Promise me that no one will read them,&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said. &ldquo;Light the oven with them this very night.&rdquo; Ursula promised and stood up to kiss him good&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bye. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I brought you a revolver,&rdquo; she murmured. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw that the sentry could not see. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do me any good,&rdquo; he said </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in a low voice, &ldquo;but give it to me in case they search you on the way out.&rdquo; Ursula took the revolver </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out of her bodice and put it under the mattress of the cot. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t say good-bye,&rdquo; he concluded </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with emphatic calmness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t beg or bow down to anyone. Pretend that they shot me a long time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ago.&rdquo; Ursula bit her lip so as not to cry. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Put some hot stones on those sores,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned halfway around and left the room. Colonel Aureliano Buendia remained standing, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thoughtful, until the door closed. Then he lay down again with his arms open. Since the beginning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of adolescence, when he had begun to be aware of his premonitions, he thought that death would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">announced with a definite, unequivocal, irrevocable signal, but there were only a few hours left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before he would die and the signal had not come. On a certain occasion a very beautiful woman had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come into his camp in Tucurinca and asked the sentries&rsquo; permission to see him. They let her through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because they were aware of the fanaticism of mothers, who sent their daughters to the bedrooms of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the most famous warriors, according to what they said, to improve the breed. That night Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia was finishing the poem about the man who is lost in the rain when the girl came </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">65 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into his room. He turned his back to her to put the sheet of paper into the locked drawer where he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kept his poetry. And then he sensed it. He grasped the pistol in the drawer without turning his head. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he turned around holding his Pistol, the girl had lowered hers and did not know what to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">do. In that way he had avoided four out of eleven traps. On the other hand, someone who was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">never caught entered the revolutionary headquarters one night in Manaure and stabbed to death his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">close friend Colonel Magnifico Visbal, to whom he had given his cot so that he could sweat out a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fever. A few yards away, sleeping in a hammock in the same room, he was not aware of anything. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His efforts to systematize his premonitions were useless. They would come suddenly in a wave of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">supernatural lucidity, like an absolute and momentaneous conviction, but they could not be grasped. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On occasion they were so natural that he identified them as premonitions only after they had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fulfilled. Frequently they were nothing but ordinary bits of superstition. But when they condemned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him to death and asked him to state his last wish, he did not have the least difficulty in identifying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the premonition that inspired his answer. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I ask that the sentence be carried out in Macondo,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The president of the court-martial was annoyed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be clever, Buendia,&rdquo; he told him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a trick to gain more time.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t fulfill it, that will be your worry.&rdquo; the colonel said, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s my last wish.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since then the premonitions had abandoned him. The day when Ursula visited him in jail, after a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">great deal of thinking he came to the conclusion that perhaps death would not be announced that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time because it did not depend on chance but on the will of his executioners. He spent the night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">awake, tormented by the pain of his sores. A little before dawn he heard steps in the hallway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; he said to himself, and for no reason he thought of Jose Arcadio Buendia, who at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that moment was thinking about him under the dreary dawn of the chestnut tree. He did not feel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fear or nostalgia, but an intestinal rage at the idea that this artificial death would not let him see the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">end of so many things that he had left unfinished. The door opened and a sentry came in with a mug </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of coffee. On the following day at the same hour he would still be doing what he was then, raging </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the pain in his armpits, and the same thing happened. On Thursday he shared the sweet milk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">candy with the guards and put on his clean clothes, which were tight for him, and the patent leather </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">boots. By Friday they had still not shot him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, they did not dare carry out the sentence. The rebelliousness of the town made the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">military men think that the execution of Colonel Aureliano Buendia might have serious political </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consequences not only in Macondo but throughout the area of the swamp, so they consulted the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">authorities in the capital of the province. On Saturday night, while they were waiting for an answer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Captain Roque Carnicero went with some other officers to Catarino&rsquo;s place. Only one woman, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">practically threatened, dared take him to her room. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to go to bed with a man they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">know is going to die,&rdquo; she confessed to him. &ldquo;No one knows how it will come, but everybody is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">going around saying that the officer who shoots Colonel Aureliano Buendia and all the soldiers in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the squad, one by one, will be murdered, with no escape, sooner or later, even if they hide at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ends of the earth.&rdquo; Captain Roque Carnicero mentioned it to the other officers and they told their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">superiors. On Sunday, although no one had revealed it openly, although no action on the part of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">military had disturbed the tense calm of those days, the whole town knew that the officers were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ready to use any manner of pretext to avoid responsibility for the execution. The official order </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arrived in the Monday mail: the execution was to be carried out within twenty-four hours. That night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the officers put seven slips of paper into a cap, and Captain Roque Carnicero&rsquo;s unpeaceful fate was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreseen by his name on the prize slip. &ldquo;Bad luck doesn&rsquo;t have any chinks in it,&rdquo; he said with deep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bitterness. &ldquo;I was born a son of a bitch and I&rsquo;m going to die a son of a bitch.&rdquo; At five in the morning </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">66 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he chose the squad by lot, formed it in the courtyard, and woke up the condemned man with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">premonitory phrase. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Buendia,&rdquo; he told him. &ldquo;Our time has come.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what it was,&rdquo; the colonel replied. &ldquo;I was dreaming that my sores had burst.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca Buendia got up at three in the morning when she learned that Aureliano would be shot. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stayed in the bedroom in the dark, watching the cemetery wall through the half-opened window </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as the bed on which she sat shook with Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s snoring. She had waited all week with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same hidden persistence with which during different times she had waited for Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s letters. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t shoot him here,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio, told her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll shoot him at midnight in the barracks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so that no one will know who made up the squad, and they&rsquo;ll bury him right there.&rdquo; Rebeca kept on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re stupid enough to shoot him here,&rdquo; she said. She was so certain that she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreseen the way she would open the door to wave good-bye. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t bring him through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">streets,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio insisted, with six scared soldiers and knowing that the people are ready for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anything.&rdquo; Indifferent to her husband&rsquo;s logic, Rebeca stayed by the window. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re just stupid enough,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On Tuesday, at five-in the. morning, Jose Arcadio had drunk his coffee and let the dogs out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when Rebeca closed the window and held onto the head of the bed so as not to fall down. &ldquo;There, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they&rsquo;re bringing him,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so handsome.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio looked out the window and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saw him. tremulous in the light of dawn. He already had his back to the wall and his hands were on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his hips because the burning knots in his armpits would not let him lower them. &ldquo;A person fucks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself up so much,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia said. &ldquo;Fucks himself up so much just so that six </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weak fairies can kill him and he can&rsquo;t do anything about it.&rdquo; He repeated it with so much rage that it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost seemed to be fervor, and Captain Roque Carnicero was touched, because he thought he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">praying. When the squad took aim, the rage had materialized into a viscous and bitter substance that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put his tongue to sleep and made him close his eyes. Then the aluminum glow of dawn disappeared </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he saw himself again in short pants, wearing a tie around his neck, and he saw his father leading </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him into the tent on a splendid afternoon, and he saw the ice. When he heard the shout he thought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it was the final command to the squad. He opened his eyes with a shudder of curiosity, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expecting to meet the incandescent trajectory of the bullets, but he only saw Captain Roque </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carnicero with his arms in the air and Jose Arcadio crossing the street with his fearsome shotgun </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ready to go off. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; the captain said to Jose Arcadio. &ldquo;You were sent by Divine Providence.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another war began right there. Captain Roque Carnicero and his six men left with Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia to free the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, who had been condemned to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death in Riohacha. They thought they could save time by crossing the mountains along the trail that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia had followed to found Macondo, but before a week was out they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced that it was an impossible undertaking. So they had to follow the dangerous route over the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">outcroppings; with no other munitions but what the firing squad had. They would camp near the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">towns and one of them, with a small gold fish in his hand, would go in disguise in broad daylight to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contact the dormant Liberals, who would go out hunting on the following morning and never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">return. When they saw Riohacha from a ridge in the mountains. General Victorio Medina had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shot. Colonel Aureliano Buendla&rsquo;s men proclaimed him chief of the revolutionary forces of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Caribbean coast with the rank of general. He assumed the position but refused the promotion and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took the stand that he would never accept it as long as the Conservative regime was in power. At the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">end of three months they had succeeded in arming more than a thousand men, but they were wiped </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out. The survivors reached the eastern frontier. The next thing that was heard of them was that they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had landed on Cabo de la Vela, coming from the smaller islands of the Antilles, and a message from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the government was sent all over by telegraph and included in jubilant proclamations throughout the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">67 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">country announcing the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. But two days later a multiple telegram </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which almost overtook the previous one announced another uprising on the southern plains. That </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was how the legend of the ubiquitous Colonel Aureliano Buendia, began. Simultaneous and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contradictory information declared him victorious in Villanueva, defeated in Guacamayal, devoured </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by Motilon Indians, dead in a village in the swamp, and up in arms again in Urumita. The Liberal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leaders, who at that moment were negotiating for participation in the congress, branded him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">adventurer who did not represent the party. The national government placed him in the category of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a bandit and put a price of five thousand pesos on his head. After sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia left Guajira with two thousand well-armed Indians and the garrison, which was taken by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surprise as it slept, abandoned Riohacha. He established his headquarters there and proclaimed total </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">war against the regime. The first message he received from the government was a threat to shoot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez within forty-eight hours if he did not withdraw with his forces to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eastern frontier. Colonel Roque Carnicero, who was his chief of staff then, gave him the telegram </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a look of consternation, but he read it with unforeseen joy. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We have a telegraph office in Macondo now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His reply was definitive. In three months he expected to establish his headquarters in Macondo. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he did not find Colonel Gerineldo Marquez alive at that time he would shoot out of hand all of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the officers he held prisoner at that moment starting with the generals, and he would give orders to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his subordinates to do the same for the rest of the war. Three months later, when he entered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo in triumph, the first embrace he received on the swamp road was that of Colonel Geri&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">neldo Marquez. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The house was full of children. Ursula had taken in Santa Sofia de la Piedad with her older </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">daughter and a pair of twins, who had been born five months after Arcadio had been shot. Contrary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the victim&rsquo;s last wishes, she baptized the girl with the name of Remedios. I&rsquo;m sure that was what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio meant,&rdquo; she alleged. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t call her Ursula, because a person suffers too much with that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">name.&rdquo; The twins were named Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo. Amaranta took care </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of them all. She put small wooden chairs in the living room and established a nursery with other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children from neighboring families. When Colonel Aureliano Buendia returned in the midst of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exploding rockets and ringing bells, a children&rsquo;s chorus welcomed him to the house. Aureliano Jose, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tall like his grandfather, dressed as a revolutionary officer, gave him military honors. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not all the news was good. A year after the flight of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Rebeca went to live in the house Arcadio had built. No one knew about his intervention to halt </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the execution. In the new house, located on the best corner of the square, in the shade of an almond </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tree that was honored by three nests of redbreasts, with a large door for visitors and four windows </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for light, they set up a hospitable home. Rebeca&rsquo;s old friends, among them four of the Moscote </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sisters who were still single, once more took up the sessions of embroidery that had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intermpted years before on the porch with the begonias. Jose Arcadio continued to profit from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">usurped lands, the title to which was recognized by the Conservative government. Every afternoon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he could be seen returning on horseback, with his hunting dogs and his double-barreled shotgun and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a string of rabbits hanging from his saddle. One September afternoon, with the threat of a storm, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returned home earlier than usual. He greeted Rebeca in the dining room, tied the dogs up in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard, hung the rabbits up in the kitchen to be salted later, and went to the bedroom to change </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his clothes. Rebeca later declared that when her husband went into the bedroom she was locked in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bathroom and did not hear anything. It was a difficult version to believe, but there was no other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more plausible, and no one could think of any motive for Rebeca to murder the man who had made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her happy. That was perhaps the only mystery that was never cleared up in Macondo. As soon as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio closed the bedroom door the sound of a pistol shot echoed through the house. A </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">68 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passed along the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, made a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">right angle at the Buendia house, went in under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the dining-room table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta&rsquo;s chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano Jose , and went through the pantry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and came out in the kitchen, where Ursula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Holy Mother of God!&rdquo; Ursula shouted. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She followed the thread of blood back along its course, and in search of its origin she went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the pantry, along the begonia porch where Aureliano Jose was chanting that three plus three </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">is six and six plus three is nine, and she crossed the dining room and the living rooms and followed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">straight down the street, and she turned first to the right and then to the left to the Street of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turks, forgetting that she was still wearing her baking apron and her house slippers, and she came </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out onto the square and went into the door of a house where she had never been, and she pushed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">open the bedroom door and was almost suffocated by the smell of burned gunpowder, and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found Jose Arcadio lying face down on the ground on top of the leggings he had just taken off, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she saw the starting point of the thread of blood that had already stopped flowing out of his right </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ear. They found no wound on his body nor could they locate the weapon. Nor was it possible to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remove the smell of powder from the corpse. First they washed him three times with soap and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scmbbing brush, and they mbbed him with salt and vinegar, then with ashes and lemon, and finally </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they put him in a barrel of lye and let him stay for six hours. They scrubbed him so much that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arabesques of his tattooing began to fade. When they thought of the desperate measure of seasoning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him with pepper, cumin seeds, and laurel leaves and boiling him for a whole day over a slow fire, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had already begun to decompose and they had to bury him hastily. They sealed him hermetically in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">special coffin seven and a half feet long and four feet wide, reinforced inside with iron plates and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fastened together with steel bolts, and even then the smell could be perceived on the streets through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which the funeral procession passed. Father Nicanor, with his liver enlarged and tight as a drum, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave him his blessing from bed. Although in the months that followed they reinforced the grave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with walls about it, between which they threw compressed ash, sawdust, and quicklime, the cemetery </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">still smelled of powder for many years after, until the engineers from the banana company covered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the grave over with a shell of concrete. As soon as they took the body out, Rebeca closed the doors </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of her house and buried herself alive, covered with a thick crust of disdain that no earthly temptation </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was ever able to break. She went out into the street on one occasion, when she was very old, with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shoes the color of old silver and a hat made of tiny flowers, during the time that the Wandering Jew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passed through town and brought on a heat wave that was so intense that birds broke through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">window screens to come to die in the bedrooms. The last time anyone saw her alive was when with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one shot she killed a thief who was trying to force the door of her house. Except for Argenida, her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">servant and confidante, no one ever had any more contact with her after that. At one time it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discovered that she was writing letters to the Bishop, whom she claimed as a first cousin, but it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">never said whether she received any reply. The town forgot about her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In spite of his triumphal return, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was not enthusiastic over the looks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of things. The government troops abandoned their positions without resistance and that aroused an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">illusion of victory among the Liberal population that it was not right to destroy, but the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">revolutionaries knew the tmth, Colonel Aureliano Buendia better than any of them. Although at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment he had more than five thousand men under his command and held two coastal states, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had the feeling of being hemmed in against the sea and caught in a situation that was so confused </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that when he ordered the restoration of the church steeple, which had been knocked down by army </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cannon fire, Father Nicanor commented from his sickbed: &ldquo;This is silly; the defenders of the faith of </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">69 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Christ destroy the church and the Masons order it rebuilt.&rdquo; Looking for a loophole through which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he could escape, he spent hours on end in the telegraph office conferring with the commanders of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other towns, and every time he would emerge with the firmest impression that the war was at a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stalemate. When news of fresh liberal victories was received it was celebrated with jubilant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proclamations, but he would measure the real extent of them on the map and could see that his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forces were penetrating into the jungle, defending themselves against malaria and mosquitoes, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">advancing in the opposite direction from reality. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting time,&rdquo; he would complain to his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting time while the bastards in the party are begging for seats in congress.&rdquo; Lying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">awake at night, stretched out on his back in a hammock in the same room where he had awaited </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death, he would evoke the image of lawyers dressed in black leaving the presidential palace in the icy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cold of early morning with their coat collars turned up about their ears, rubbing their hands, whis&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pering, taking refuge in dreary early-morning cafes to speculate over what the president had meant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he said yes, or what he had meant when he said no, and even to imagine what the president </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was thinking when he said something quite different, as he chased away mosquitoes at a temperature </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of ninety-five degrees, feeling the approach of the fearsome dawn when he would have to give his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">men the command to jump into the sea. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night of uncertainty, when Pilar Ternera was singing in the courtyard with the soldiers, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked her to read the future in her cards. &ldquo;Watch out for your mouth,&rdquo; was all that Pilar Ternera </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought out after spreading and picking up the cards three times. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it means, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the sign is very clear. Watch out for your mouth.&rdquo; Two days later someone gave an orderly a mug of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">black coffee and the orderly passed it on to someone else and that one to someone else until, hand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to hand, it reached Colonel Aureliano Buendia office. He had not asked for any coffee, but since it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was there the colonel drank it. It had a dose of nux vomica strong enough to kill a horse. When they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took him home he was stiff and arched and his tongue was sticking out between his teeth. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fought against death over him. After cleaning out his stomach with emetics, she wrapped him in hot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">blankets and fed him egg whites for two days until his harrowed body recovered its normal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">temperature. On the fourth day he was out of danger. Against his will, pressured by Ursula and his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officers, he stayed in bed for another week. Only then did he learn that Iris verses had not been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burned. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to be hasty,&rdquo; Ursula explained to him. &ldquo;That night when I went to light the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">oven I said to myself that it would be better to wait until they brought the body.&rdquo; In the haze of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convalescence, surrounded by Remedios&rsquo; dusty dolls. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, brought back the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decisive periods of his existence by reading his poetry. He started writing again. For many hours, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">balancing on the edge of the surprises of a war with no future, in rhymed verse he resolved his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">experience on the shores of death. Then his thoughts became so clear that he was able to examine </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them forward and backward. One night he asked Colonel Gerineldo Marquez: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell me something, old friend: why are you fighting?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What other reason could there be?&rdquo; Colonel Gerineldo Marquez answered. &ldquo;For the great liberal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">party.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky because you know why,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I&rsquo;ve come to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">realize only just now that I&rsquo;m fighting because of pride.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; Colonel Gerineldo Marquez said. Colonel Aureliano Buendia was amused at his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">alarm. &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But in any case, it&rsquo;s better than not knowing why you&rsquo;re fighting.&rdquo; He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looked him in the eyes and added with a smile: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Or fighting, like you, for something that doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning for anyone.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His pride had prevented him from making contact with the armed groups in the interior of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">country until the leaders of the party publicly rectified their declaration that he was a bandit. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew, however, that as soon as he put those scruples aside he would break the vicious circle of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">war. Convalescence gave him time to reflect. Then he succeeded in getting Ursula to give him the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">70 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rest of her buried inheritance and her substantial savings. He named Colonel Gerineldo Marquez </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">civil and military leader of Macondo and he went off to make contact with the rebel groups in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interior. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was not only the man closest to Colonel Aureliano Buendia, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula received him as a member of the family. Fragile, timid, with natural good manners, he was, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">however, better suited for war than for government. His political advisers easily entangled him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">theoretical labyrinths. But he succeeded in giving Macondo the atmosphere of rural peace that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano, Buendia dreamed of so that he could die of old age making little gold fishes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he lived in his parents&rsquo; house he would have lunch at Ursula&rsquo;s two or three times a week. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He initiated Aureliano Jose in the use of firearms, gave him early military instruction, and for several </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months took him to live in the barracks, with Ursula&rsquo;s consent, so that he could become a man. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many years before, when he was still almost a child, Gerineldo Marquez had declared his love for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta. At that time she was so illusioned with her lonely passion for Pietro Crespi that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laughed at him. Gerineldo Marquez waited. On a certain occasion he sent Amaranta a note from jail </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asking her to embroider a dozen batiste handkerchiefs with his father&rsquo;s initials on them. He sent her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the money. A week later Amaranta, brought the dozen handkerchiefs to him in jail along with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">money and they spent several hours talking about the past. &ldquo;When I get out of here I&rsquo;m going to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marry you,&rdquo; Gerineldo Marquez told her when she left. Amaranta laughed but she kept on thinking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about him while she taught the children to read and she tried to revive her juvenile passion for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pietro Crespi. On Saturday, visiting days for the prisoners, she would stop by the house of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo Marquez&rsquo;s parents and accompany them to the jail. On one of those Saturdays Ursula was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surprised to see her in the kitchen, waiting for the biscuits to come out of the oven so that she could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pick the best ones and cap them in a napkin that she had embroidered for the occasion. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Marty him,&rdquo; she told her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a hard time finding another man like him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta feigned a reaction of displeasure. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to go around hunting for men,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking these biscuits to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo because I&rsquo;m sorry that sooner or later they&rsquo;re going to shoot him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said it without thinking, but that was the time that the government had announced its threat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to shoot Colonel Gerineldo Marquez if the rebel forces did not surrender Riohacha. The visits </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stopped. Amaranta shut herself up to weep, overwhelmed by a feeling of guilt similar to the one that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had tormented her when Remedios died, as if once more her careless words had been responsible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for a death. Her mother consoled her. She inured her that Colonel Aureliano Buendia would do </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">something to prevent the execution and promised that she would take charge of attracting Gerineldo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marquez herself when the war was over. She fulfilled her promise before the imagined time. When </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo Marquez returned to the house, invested with his new dignity of civil and military leader, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she received him as a son, thought of delightful bits of flattery to hold him there, and prayed with all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her soul that he would remember his plan to marry Amaranta. Her pleas seemed to be answered. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the days that he would have lunch at the house. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez would linger on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">begonia porch playing Chinese checkers with Amaranta. Ursula would bring them coffee and milk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and biscuits and would take over the children so that they would not bother them. Amaranta was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">really making an effort to kindle in her heart the forgotten ashes of her youthful passion. With an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anxiety that came to be intolerable, she waited for the lunch days, the afternoons of Chinese </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">checkers, and time flew by in the company of the warrior with a nostalgic name whose fingers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trembled imperceptibly as he moved the pieces. But the day on which Colonel Gerineldo Marquez </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">repeated his wish to marry her, she rejected him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to marry anyone,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;much less you. You love Aureliano so much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that you want to marry me because you can&rsquo;t marry him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">71 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was a patient man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep on insisting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sooner or later </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll convince you.&rdquo; He kept on visiting the house. Shut up in her bedroom biting back her secret </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tears, Amaranta put her fingers in her ears so as not to bear the voice of the suitor as he gave Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the latest war news, and in spite of the fact that she was dying to see him she had the strength not to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">go out and meet him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that time Colonel Aureliano Buendia took the time to send a detailed account to Macondo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">every two weeks. But only once, almost eight months after he had left, did he write to Ursula. A </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">special messenger brought a sealed envelope to the house with a sheet of paper inside bearing the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colonel&rsquo;s delicate hand: Take good care of Papa because he is going to die. Ursula became alarmed. &ldquo;If </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano says so it&rsquo;s because Aureliano knows,&rdquo; she said. And she had them help her take Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia to his bedroom. Not only was he as heavy as ever, but during his prolonged stay </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">under the chestnut tree he had developed the faculty of being able to increase his weight at will, to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">such a degree that seven men were unable to lift him and they had to drag him to the bed. A smell </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of tender mushrooms, of wood-flower fungus, of old and concentrated outdoors impregnated the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">air of the bedroom as it was breathed by the colossal old man weather-beaten by the sun and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rain. The next morning he was not in his bed. In spite of his undiminished strength, Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia was in no condition to resist. It was all the same to him. If he went back to the chestnut </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tree it was not because he wanted to but because of a habit of his body. Ursula took care of him, fed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him, brought him news of Aureliano. But actually, the only person with whom he was able to have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contact for a long time was Pmdencio Aguilar. Almost pulverized at that time by the decrepitude of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death, Pmdencio Aguilar would come twice a day to chat with him. They talked about fighting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cocks. They promised each other to set up a breeding farm for magnificent birds, not so much to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enjoy their victories, which they would not need then, as to have something to do on the tedious </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sundays of death. It was Pmdencio Aguilar who cleaned him fed him and brought him splendid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">news of an unknown person called Aureliano who was a colonel in the war. When he was alone, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia consoled himself with the dream of the infinite rooms. He dreamed that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was getting out of bed, opening the door and going into an identical room with the same bed with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrought-iron head, the same wicker chair, and the same small picture of the Virgin of Help on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back wall. From that room he would go into another that was just the same, the door of which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would open into another that was just the same, the door of which would open into another one just </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the same, and then into another exactly alike, and so on to infinity. He liked to go from room to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room. As in a gallery of parallel mirrors, until Pmdencio Aguilar would touch him on the shoulder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he would go back from room to room, walking in reverse, going back over his trail, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would find Pmdencio Aguilar in the room of reality. But one night, two weeks after they took him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to his bed, Pmdencio Aguilar touched his shoulder in an intermediate room and he stayed there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forever, thinking that it was the real room. On the following morning Ursula was bringing him his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">breakfast when she saw a man coming along the hall. He was short and stocky, with a black suit on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and a hat that was also black, enormous, pulled down to his taciturn eyes. &ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought, &ldquo;I could have sworn it was Melqufades.&rdquo; It was Cataure, Visitacion&rsquo;s brother, who had left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house fleeing from the insomnia plague and of whom there had never been any news. Visitacion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked him why he had come back, and he answered her in their solemn language: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have come for the exequies of the king.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then they went into Jose Arcadio Buendfa&rsquo;s room, shook him as hard as they could, shouted in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his ear, put a mirror in front of his nostrils, but they could not awaken him. A short time later, when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the carpenter was taking measurements for the coffin, through the window they saw a light rain of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tiny yellow flowers falling. They fell on the town all through the night in a silent storm, and they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">covered the roofs and blocked the doors and smothered the animals who dept outdoors. So many </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">72 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had to clear them away with shovels and rakes so that the funeral procession could pass by. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">73 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 8 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SITTNG IN THE WICKER ROCKING chair with her interrupted work in her lap, Amaranta watched </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, Jose , his chin covered with foam, stropping his razor to give himself his first shave. His </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">blackheads bled and he cut his upper lip as he tried to shape a mustache of blond fuzz and when it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was all over he looked the same as before, but the laborious process gave Amaranta the feeling that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had begun to grow old at that moment. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You look just like Aureliano when he was your age,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a man now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had been for a long time, ever since that distant day when Amaranta thought he was still a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">child and continued getting undressed in front of him in the bathroom as she had always done, as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had been used to doing ever since Pilar Ternera had turned him over to her to finish his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">upbringing. The first time that he saw her the only thing that drew his attention was the deep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">depression between her breasts. He was so innocent that he asked her what had happened to her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Amaranta pretended to dig into her breasts with the tips of her fingers and answered: &ldquo;They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave me some terrible cuts.&rdquo; Some time later, when she had recovered from Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s suicide </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and would bathe with Aureliano Jose again, he no longer paid attention to the depression but felt a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strange trembling at the sight of the splendid breasts with their brown nipples. He kept on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">examining her, discovering the miracle of her intimacy inch by inch, and he felt his skin tingle as he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contemplated the way her skin tingled when it touched the water. Ever since he was a small child he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had the custom of leaving his hammock and waking up in Amaranta&rsquo;s bed, because contact with her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a way of overcoming his fear of the dark. But since that day when he became aware of his own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nakedness, it was not fear of the dark that drove him to crawl in under her mosquito netting but an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">urge to feel Amaranta&rsquo;s warm breathing at dawn. Early one morning during the time when she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">refused Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, Aureliano Jose awoke with the feeling that he could not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">breathe. He felt Amaranta&rsquo;s fingers searching across his stomach like warm and anxious little </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">caterpillars. Pretending to sleep, he changed his position to make it easier, and then he felt the hand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without the black bandage diving like a blind shellfish into the algae of his anxiety. Although they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seemed to ignore what both of them knew and what each one knew that the other knew, from that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night on they were yoked together in an inviolable complicity. Aureliano Jose could not get to sleep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">until he heard the twelve-o&rsquo;clock waltz on the parlor dock, and the mature maiden whose skin was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beginning to grow sad did not have a moments&rsquo; rest until she felt slip in under her mosquito netting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that sleepwalker whom she had raised, not thinking that he would be a palliative for her solitude. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later they not only slept together, naked, exchanging exhausting caresses, but they would also chase </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">each other into the corners of the house and shut themselves up in the bedrooms at any hour of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day in a permanent state of unrelieved excitement. They were almost discovered by Ursula one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">afternoon when she went into the granary as they were starting to kiss. &ldquo;Do you love your aunt a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lot?&rdquo; she asked Aureliano Jose in an innocent way. He answered that he did. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good of you,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula concluded and finished measuring the flour for the bread and returned to the kitchen. That </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">episode drew Amaranta out of her delirium. She realized that she had gone too far, that she was no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">longer playing kissing games with a child, but was floundering about in an autumnal passion, one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was dangerous and had no future, and she cut it off with one stroke. Aureliano Jose, who was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then finishing his military training, finally woke up to reality and went to sleep in the barracks. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturdays he would go with the soldiers to Catarino&rsquo;s store. He was seeking consolation for his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">abrupt solitude, for his premature adolescence with women who smelled of dead flowers, whom he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">idealized in the darkness and changed into Amaranta by means of the anxious efforts of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">imagination. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">74 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A short time later contradictory news of the war began to come in. While the government itself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">admitted the progress of the rebellion, the officers in Macondo had confidential reports of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">imminence of a negotiated peace. Toward the first of April a special emissary identified himself to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. He confirmed the fact to him that the leaders of the party had indeed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">established contact with the rebel leaders in the interior and were on the verge of arranging an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armistice in exchange for three cabinet posts for the Liberals, a minority representation in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">congress, and a general amnesty for rebels who laid down their arms. The emissary brought a highly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confidential order from Colonel Aureliano Buendfa, who was not in agreement with the terms of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armistice. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was to choose five of his best men and prepare to leave the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">country with them. The order would be carried out with the strictest secrecy. One week before the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">agreement was announced, and in the midst of a storm of contradictory mmors, Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa and ten tmsted officers, among them Colonel Roque Carnicero, stealthily arrived in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo after midnight, dismissed the garrison, buried their weapons, and destroyed their records. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By dawn they had left town, along with Colonel Gerineldo Marquez and his five officers. It was such </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a quick and secret operation that Ursula did not find out about it until the last moment, when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">someone tapped on her bedroom window and whispered, &ldquo;If you want to see Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa, come to the door right now.&rdquo; Ursula Jumped out of bed and went to the door in her night&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gown and she was just able to see the horsemen who were leaving town gallop off in a mute cloud </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of dust. Only on the following day did she discover that Aureliano Jose had gone with his father. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ten days after a joint communique by the government and the opposition announced the end of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the war, there was news of the first armed uprising of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa on the western </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">border. His small and poorly armed force was scattered in less than a week. But during that year, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">while Liberals and Conservatives tried to make the country believe in reconciliation, he attempted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seven other revolts. One night he bombarded Riohacha from a schooner and the garrison dragged </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out of bed and shot the fourteen best-known Liberals in the town as a reprisal. For more than two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weeks he held a customs post on the border and from there sent the nation a call to general war. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another of his expectations was lost for three months in the jungle in a mad attempt to cross more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than a thousand miles of virgin territory in order to proclaim war on the outskirts of the capital. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one occasion he was lea than fifteen miles away from Macondo and was obliged by government </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patrols to hide in the mountains, very close to the enchanted region where his father had found the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fossil of a Spanish galleon many years before. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Visitacion died around that time. She had the pleasure of dying a natural death after having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">renounced a throne out of fear of insomnia, and her last wish was that they should dig up the wages </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had saved for more than twenty years under her bed and send the money to Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa so that he could go on with the war. But Ursula did not bother to dig it up because it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rumored in those days that Colonel Aureliano Buendfa had been killed in a landing near the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">provincial capital. The official announcement&mdash;the fourth in less than two years&mdash;was considered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">true for almost six months because nothing further was heard of him. Suddenly, when Ursula and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta had added new mourning to the past period, unexpected news arrived. Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa was alive, but apparently he had stopped harassing the government of his country and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">joined with the victorious federalism of other republics of the Caribbean. He would show up under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">different names farther and farther away from his own country. Later it would be learned that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">idea that was working on him at the time was the unification of the federalist forms of Central </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">America in order to wipe out conservative regimes from Alaska to Patagonia. The first direct news </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Ursula received from him, several years after his departure, was a wrinkled and faded letter that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had arrived, passing through various hands, from Santiago, Cuba. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost him forever,&rdquo; Ursula exclaimed on reading it. &ldquo;If he follows this path he&rsquo;ll spend </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Christmas at the ends of the earth.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">75 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person to whom she said it, who was the first to whom she showed the letter, was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conservative general Jose Raquel Moncada, mayor of Macondo since the end of the war. &ldquo;This </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano,&rdquo; General Moncada commented, &ldquo;what a pity that he&rsquo;s not a Conservative.&rdquo; He really </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">admired him. Like many Conservative civilians, Jose Raquel Moncada had waged war in defense of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his party and had earned the title of general on the field of battle, even though he was not a military </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man by profession. On the contrary, like so many of his fellow party members, he was an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">antimilitarist. He considered military men unprincipled loafers, ambitious plotters, experts in facing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down civilians in order to prosper during times of disorder. Intelligent, pleasant, mddy-faced, a man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who liked to eat and watch cockfights, he had been at one time the most feared adversary of Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendfa. He succeeded in imposing his authority over the career officers in a wide sector </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">along the coast. One time when he was forced by strategic circumstances to abandon a stronghold </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the forces of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa, he left two letters for him. In one of them quite long, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invited him to join in a campaign to make war more humane. The other letter was for his wife, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lived in Liberal territory, and he left it with a plea to see that it reached its destination. From then on, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even in the bloodiest periods of the war, the two commanders would arrange tmces to exchange </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prisoners. They were pauses with a certain festive atmosphere, which General Moncada took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">advantage of to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendfa how to play chess. They became great friends. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They even came to think about the possibility of coordinating the popular elements of both parties, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doing away with the influence of the military men and professional politicians, and setting up a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">humanitarian regime that would take the best from each doctrine. When the war was over, while </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano, Buendfa was sneaking about through the narrow trails of permanent sub. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">version, General Moncada was named magistrate of Macondo. He wore civilian clothes, replaced the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soldiers with unarmed policemen, enforced the amnesty laws, and helped a few families of Liberals </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who had been killed in the war. He succeeded in having Macondo raised to the status of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">municipality and he was therefore its first mayor, and he created an atmosphere of confidence that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made people think of the war as an absurd nightmare of the past. Father Nicanor, consumed by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hepatic fever, was replaced by Father Coronel, whom they called &ldquo;The Pup,&rdquo; a veteran of the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">federalist war. Bruno Crespi, who was married to Amparo Mos. cote, and whose shop of toys and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">musical instruments continued to prosper, built a theater which Spanish companies included in their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Itineraries. It was a vast open-air hall with wooden benches, a velvet curtain with Greek masks, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">three box offices in the shape of lions&rsquo; heads, through whose mouths the tickets were sold. It was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">also about that time that the school was rebuilt. It was put under the charge of Don Melchor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Escalona, an old teacher brought from the swamp, who made his lazy students walk on their knees </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the lime-coated courtyard and made the students who talked in class eat hot chili with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">approval of their parents. Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo, the willful twins of Santa </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sofia de la Piedad, were the first to sit in the classroom, with their slates, their chalk, and their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">aluminum jugs with their names on them. Remedios, who inherited her mother&rsquo;s pure beauty, began </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to be known as Remedios the Beauty. In spite of time, of the superimposed Periods of mourning, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and her accumulated afflictions, Ursula resisted growing old. Aided by Santa Sofia de la Piedad, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave a new drive to her pastry business and in a few years not only recovered the fortune that her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">son had spent in the war, but she once more stuffed with pure gold the gourds buried in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom. &ldquo;As long as God gives me life,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;there will always be money in this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">madhouse.&rdquo; That was how things were when Aureliano Jose deserted the federal troops in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicaragua, signed on as a crewman on a German ship, and appeared in the kitchen of the house, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sturdy as a horse, as dark and long-haired as an Indian, and with a secret determination to marry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Amaranta, saw him come in, even though he said nothing she knew immediately why he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had come back. At the table they did not dare look each other in the face. But two weeks after his </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">76 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">return, in the presence of Ursula, he set his eyes on hers and said to her, &ldquo;I always thought a lot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about you.&rdquo; Amaranta avoided him. She guarded against chance meetings. She tried not to become </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">separated from Remedios the Beauty. She was ashamed of the blush that covered her cheeks on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day her nephew asked her how long she intended wearing the black bandage on her hand, for she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interpreted it as an allusion to her virginity. When he arrived, she barred the door of her bedroom, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but she heard his peaceful snoring in the next room for so many nights that she forgot about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">precaution. Early one morning, almost two months after his return, she heard him come into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom. Then, instead of fleeing, instead of shouting as she had thought she would, she let herself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">be saturated with a soft feeling of relaxation. She felt him slip in under the mosquito netting as he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had done when he was a child, as he had always done, and she could not repress her cold sweat and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the chattering of her teeth when she realized that he was completely naked. &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whispered, suffocating with curiosity. &ldquo;Go away or I&rsquo;ll scream.&rdquo; But Aureliano Jose knew then what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he had to do, because he was no longer a child but a barracks animal. Starting with that night the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dull, inconsequential battles began again and would go on until dawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your aunt,&rdquo; Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">murmured, spent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as if I were your mother, not just because of my age but because the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only thing I didn&rsquo;t do for you was nurse you.&rdquo; Aureliano would escape at dawn and come back early </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the morning on the next day, each time more excited by the proof that she had not barred the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">door. He had nit stopped desiring her for a single instant. He found her in the dark bedrooms of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">captured towns, especially in the most abject ones, and he would make her materialize in the smell </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of dry blood on the bandages of the wounded, in the instantaneous terror of the danger of death, at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all times and in all places. He had fled from her in an attempt to wipe out her memory, not only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through distance but by means of a muddled fury that his companions at arms took to be boldness, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but the more her image wallowed in the dunghill of the war, the more the war resembled Amaranta. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how he suffered in exile, looking for a way of lulling her with, his own death, until he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heard some old man tell the tale of the man who had married his aunt, who was also his cousin, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whose son ended up being his own grandfather. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can a person marry his own aunt?&rdquo; he asked, startled. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He not only can do that, a soldier answered him. &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re fighting this war against the priests </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so that a person can marry his own mother.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two weeks later he deserted. He found Amaranta more withered than in his memory, more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">melancholy and shy, and now really turning the last corner of maturity, but more feverish than ever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the darkness of her bedroom and more challenging than ever in the aggressiveness of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">resistance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brute,&rdquo; Amaranta would tell him as she was harried by his hounds. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">do that to a poor aunt unless you have a special dispensation from the Pope.&rdquo; Aureliano, Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promised to go to Rome, he promised to go across Europe on his knees to kiss the sandals of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pontiff just so that she would lower her drawbridge. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just that,&rdquo; Amaranta retorted. &ldquo;Any children will be born with the tail of a pig.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Jose was deaf to all arguments. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re born as armadillos,&rdquo; he begged. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Early one morning, vanquished by the unbearable pain of repressed virility, he went to Catarino&rsquo;s. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He found a woman with flaccid breasts, affectionate and cheap, who calmed his stomach for some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time. He tried to apply the treatment of disdain to Amaranta. He would see her on the porch </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">working at the sewing machine, which she had learned to operate with admirable skill, and he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not even speak to her. Amaranta felt freed of a reef, and she herself did not understand why she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">started thinking again at that time about Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, why she remembered with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">such nostalgia the afternoons of Chinese checkers, and why she even desired him as the man in her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom. Aureliano, Jose did not realize how much ground he had lost on, the night he could no </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">77 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">longer bear the farce of indifference and went back to Amaranta&rsquo;s room. She rejected him with an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inflexible and unmistakable determination, and she barred the door of her bedroom forever. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few months after the return of Aureliano Jose an exuberant woman perfumed with jasmine </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appeared at the house with a boy of five. She stated that he was the son of Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia and that she had brought him to Ursula to be baptized. No one doubted the origins of that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nameless child: he looked exactly like the colonel at the time he was taken to see ice for the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time. The woman said that he had been born with his eyes open, looking at people with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">judgment of an adult, and that she was frightened by his way of staring at things without blinking. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s identical,&rdquo; Ursula said. &ldquo;The only thing missing is for him to make chairs rock by simply </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looking at them.&rdquo; They christened him Aureliano and with his mother&rsquo;s last name, since the law did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not permit a person to bear his father&rsquo;s name until he had recognized him. General Moncada was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the godfather. Although Amaranta insisted that he be left so that she could take over his upbringing, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his mother was against it. Ursula at that time did not know about the custom of sending virgins to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bedrooms of soldiers in the same way that hens are turned loose with fine roosters, but in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">course of that year she found out: nine more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendia were brought to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house to be baptized. The oldest, a strange dark boy with green eyes, who was not at all like his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">father&rsquo;s family, was over ten years old. They brought children of all ages, all colors, but all males and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all with a look of solitude that left no doubt as to the relationship. Only two stood out in the group. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One, large for his age, made smithereens out of the flowerpots and china because his hands seemed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to have the property of breaking everything they touched. The other was a blond boy with the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">light eyes as his mother, whose hair had been left to grow long and curly like that of a woman. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">entered the house with a great deal of familiarity, as if he had been raised there, and he went directly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to a chest in Ursula&rsquo;s bedroom and demanded, &ldquo;I want the mechanical ballerina.&rdquo; Ursula was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">startled. She opened the chest, searched among the ancient and dusty articles left from the days of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melqufades, and wrapped in a pair of stockings she found the mechanical ballerina that Pietro Crespi </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had brought to the house once and that everyone had forgotten about. In less than twelve years they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">baptized with the name Aureliano and the last name of the mother all the sons that the colonel had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">implanted up and down his theater of war: seventeen. At first Ursula would fill their pockets with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">money and Amaranta tried to have them stay. But they finally limited themselves to giving them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">presents and serving as godmothers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our duty by baptizing them,&rdquo; Ursula would say, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">jotting down in a ledger the name and address of the mother and the place and date of birth of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">child. &ldquo;Aureliano needs well-kept accounts so that he can decide things when he comes back.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During lunch, commenting with General Moncada about that disconcerting proliferation, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expressed the desire for Colonel Aureliano Buendia to come back someday and gather all of his sons </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">together in the house. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, dear friend,&rdquo; General Moncada said enigmatically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come sooner than you </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suspect.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What General Moncada knew and what he did not wish to reveal at lunch was that Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia was already on his way to head up the most prolonged, radical, and bloody </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rebellion of all those he had started up till then. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The situation again became as tense as it had been during the months that preceded the first war. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cockfights, instituted by the mayor himself, were suspended. Captain Aquiles Ricardo, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">commander of the garrison, took over the exercise of municipal power. The Liberals looked upon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him as a provocateur. &ldquo;Something terrible is going to happen,&rdquo; Ursula would say to Aureliano Jose. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go out into the street after six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; The entreaties were useless. Aureliano Jose, just like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio in other times, had ceased to belong to her. It was as if his return home, the possibility of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">existing without concerning himself with everyday necessities, had awakened in him the lewd and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lazy leanings of his uncle Jose Arcadio. His passion for Amaranta had been extinguished without </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">78 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leaving any scars. He would drift around, playing pool, easing his solitude with occasional women, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sacking the hiding places where Ursula had forgotten her money. He ended up coming home only to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">change his clothes. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all alike,&rdquo; Ursula lamented. &ldquo;At first they behave very well, they&rsquo;re </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">obedient and prompt and they don&rsquo;t seem capable of killing a fly, but as soon as their beards appear </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they go to ruin.&rdquo; Unlike Arcadio, who had never known his real origins, he found out that he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the son of Pilar Ternera, who had hung up a hammock so that he could take his siesta in her house. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More than mother and son, they were accomplices in solitude. Pilar Ternera had lost the trail of all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hope. Her laugh had taken on the tones of an organ, her breasts had succumbed to the tedium of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">endless caressing, her stomach and her thighs had been the victims of her irrevocable fate as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shared woman, but her heart grew old without bitterness. Fat, talkative, with the airs of a matron in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disgrace, she renounced the sterile illusions of her cards and found peace and consolation in other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people&rsquo;s loves. In the house where Aureliano Jose took his siesta, the girls from the neighborhood </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would receive their casual lovers. &ldquo;Lend me your room, Pilar,&rdquo; they would simply say when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were already inside. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Pilar would answer. And if anyone was present she would explain: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy knowing that people are happy in bed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never charged for the service. She never refused the favor, just as she never refused the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">countless men who sought her out, even in the twilight of her maturity, without giving her money or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">love and only occasionally pleasure. Her five daughters, who inherited a burning seed, had been lost </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the byways of life since adolescence. Of the two sons she managed to raise, one died fighting in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the forces of Colonel Aureliano Buendia and the other was wounded and captured at the age of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fourteen when he tried to steal a crate of chickens in a town in the swamp. In a certain way, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Jose was the tall, dark man who had been promised her for half a century by the king of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hearts, and like all men sent by the cards he reached her heart when he was already stamped with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mark of death. She saw it in the cards. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go out tonight,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Stay and sleep here because Carmelita Montiel is getting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tired of asking me to put her in your room.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Jose did not catch the deep feeling of begging that was in the offer. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell her to wait for me at midnight&rdquo; he said. He went to the theater, where a Spanish company </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was putting on The Dagger of the Fox, which was really Zorzilla&rsquo;s play with the title changed by order </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Captain Aquiles Ricardo, because the Liberals called the Conservatives Goths. Only when he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">handed in his ticket at the door did Aureliano Jose realize that Captain Aquiles Ricardo and two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soldiers armed with rifles were searching the audience. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be careful, captain,&rdquo; Aureliano Jose warned him. &ldquo;The man hasn&rsquo;t been born yet who can lay </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hands on me.&rdquo; The captain tried to search him forcibly and Aureliano Jose, who was unarmed, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to mn. The soldiers disobeyed the order to shoot. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Buendia,&rdquo; one of them explained. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blind with rage, the captain then snatched away the rifle, stepped into the center of the street, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took aim.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I only wish it was Colonel Aureliano Buendia.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carmelita Montiel, a twenty-year-old virgin, had just bathed in orange-blossom water and was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strewing rosemary leaves on Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s bed when the shot rang out. Aureliano Jose had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">destined to find with her the happiness that Amaranta had denied him, to have seven children, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to die in her arms of old age, but the bullet that entered his back and shattered his chest had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">directed by a wrong interpretation of the cards. Captain Aquiles Ricardo, who was really the one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">destined to die that night, did indeed die, four hours before Aureliano Jose. As won as the shot was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heard he was brought down by two simultaneous bullets whose origin was never established and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shout of many voices shook the night. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long live the Liberal party! Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendia!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">79 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At twelve o&rsquo;clock, when Aureliano, Jose had bled to death and Carmelita Montiel found that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cards showing her future were blank, more than four hundred men had filed past the theater and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discharged their revolvers into the abandoned body of Captain Aquiles Ricardo. A patrol had to use </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a wheelbarrow to carry the body, which was heavy with lead and fell apart like a water-soaked loaf of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bread. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Annoyed by the outrages of the regular army, General Jose Raquel Moncada used his political </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">influence, put on his uniform again, and assumed the civil and military leadership of Macondo. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not expect, however, that his conciliatory attitude would be able to prevent the inevitable. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">news in September was contradictory. While the government announced that it was maintaining </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">control throughout the country, the Liberals were receiving secret news of armed uprisings in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interior. The regime would not admit a state of war until it was proclaimed in a decree that had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">followed a court-martial which had condemned Colonel Aureliano Buendia to death in absentia. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first unit that captured him was ordered to carry the sentence out. &ldquo;This means he&rsquo;s come back,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula said joyfully to General Moncada. But he himself knew nothing about it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, Colonel Aureliano Buendia had been in the country for more than a month. He was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">preceded by conflicting rumors, supposed to be in the most distant places at the same time, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even General Moncada did not believe in his return until it was officially announced that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seized two states on the coast. &ldquo;Congratulations, dear friend,&rdquo; he told Ursula, showing her the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">telegram. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon have him here.&rdquo; Ursula was worried then for the first time. &ldquo;And what will </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you do?&rdquo; she asked. General Moncada had asked himself that same question many times. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The same as he, my friend,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my duty.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At dawn on the first of October Colonel Aureliano Buendia attacked Macondo with a thousand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">well-armed men and the garrison received orders to resist to the end. At noon, while General </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moncada was lunching with Ursula, a rebel cannon shot that echoed in the whole town blew the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">front of the municipal treasury to dust. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re as well armed as we are,&rdquo; General Moncada sighed, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;but besides that they&rsquo;re fighting because they want to.&rdquo; At two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, while the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">earth trembled with the artillery fire from both sides, he took leave of Ursula with the certainty that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was fighting a losing battle. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I pray to God that you won&rsquo;t have Aureliano in the house tonight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If it does happen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that way, give him an embrace for me, because I don&rsquo;t expect ever to see him again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night he was captured when he tried to escape from Macondo, after writing a long letter to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia in which he reminded him of their common aim to humanize the war </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he wished him a final victory over the corruption of the militarists and the ambitions of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">politicians in both parties. On the following day Colonel Aureliano Buendia had lunch with him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula&rsquo;s house, where he was being held until a revolutionary court-martial decided his fate. It was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">friendly gathering. But while the adversaries forgot the war to remember things of the past, Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had the gloomy feeling that her son was an intruder. She had felt it ever since she saw him come in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">protected by a noisy military retinue, which turned the bedrooms inside out until they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced there was no danger. Colonel Aureliano Buendia not only accepted it but he gave strict </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">orders that no one should come closer than ten feet, not even Ursula, while the members of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">escort finished placing guards about the house. He was wearing an ordinary denim uniform with no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insignia of any kind and high boots with spurs that were caked with mud and dried blood. On his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waist he wore a holster with the flap open and his hand, which was always on the butt of the pistol, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">revealed the same watchful and resolute tension as his look. His head, with deep recessions in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hairline now, seemed to have been baked in a slow oven. His face, tanned by the salt of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Caribbean, had acquired a metallic hardness. He was preserved against imminent old age by a vitality </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that had something to do with the coldness of his insides. He was taller than when he had left, paler </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and bonier, and he showed the first symptoms of resistance to nostalgia. &ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; Ursula said </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">80 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to herself. &ldquo;Now he looks like a man capable of anything.&rdquo; He was. The Aztec shawl that he brought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta, the remembrances he spoke of at lunch, the funny stories her told were simple leftovers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from his humor of a different time. As soon as the order to bury the dead in a common grave was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carried out, he assigned Colonel Roque Carnicero the minion of setting up courts-martial and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went ahead with the exhausting task of imposing radical reforms which would not leave a stone of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the reestablished Conservative regime in place. &ldquo;We have to get ahead of the politicians in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">party,&rdquo; he said to his aides. &ldquo;When they open their eyes to reality they&rsquo;ll find accomplished facts.&rdquo; It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was then that he decided to review the titles to land that went back a hundred years and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discovered the legalized outrages of his brother, Jose Arcadio. He annulled the registrations with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stroke of the pen. As a last gesture of courtesy, he left his affairs for an hour and visited Rebeca to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bring her up to date on what he was determined to do. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the shadows of her house, the solitary widow who at one time had been the confidante of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">repressed loves and whose persistence had saved his life was a specter out of the past. Encased in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">black down to her knuckles, with her heart turned to ash, she scarcely knew anything about the war. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia had the impression that the phosphorescence of her bones was showing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through her skin and that she moved in an atmosphere of Saint Elmo&rsquo;s fire, in a stagnant air where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one could still note a hidden smell of gunpowder. He began by advising her to moderate the rigor of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her mourning, to ventilate the house, to forgive the world for the death of Jose Arcadio. But Rebeca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was already beyond any vanity. After searching for it uselessly in the taste of earth, in, the perfumed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letters from Pietro Crespi, in the tempestuous bed of her husband, she had found peace in that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house where memories materialized through the strength of implacable evocation and walked like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">human beings through the cloistered rooms. Leaning back in her wicker rocking chair, looking at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia as if he were the one who looked like a ghost out of the past, Rebeca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was not even upset by the news that the lands usurped by Jose Arcadio would be returned to their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rightful owners. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whatever you decide will be done, Aureliano,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I always thought and now I have the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proof that you&rsquo;re a renegade.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The revision of the deeds took place at the same time as the summary courts-martial presided </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over by Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, which ended with the execution of all officers of the regular </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">army who had been taken prisoner by the revolutionaries. The last court-martial was that of Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raquel Moncada. Ursula intervened. &lsquo;&rdquo;His government was the best we&rsquo;ve ever had in Macondo,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she told Colonel Aureliano Buendia. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to tell you anything about his good heart, about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his affection for us, because you know better than anyone.&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia gave her a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disapproving look. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take over the job of administering justice,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If you have something to say, tell </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it to the court-martial.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula not only did that she also brought all of the mothers of the revolutionary officers who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lived in Macondo to testify. One by one the old women who had been founders of the town, several </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of whom had taken part in the daring crossing of the mountains, praised the virtues of General </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moncada. Ursula was the last in line. Her gloomy dignity, the weight of her name, the convincing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vehemence of her declaration made the scale of justice hesitate for a moment. &ldquo;You have taken this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">horrible game very seriously and you have done well because you are doing your duty,&rdquo; she told the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">members of the court. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t forget that as long as God gives us life we will still be mothers and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no matter how revolutionary you may be, we have the right to pull down your pants and give you a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whipping at the first sign of disrespect.&rdquo; The court retired to deliberate as those words still echoed in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the school that had been turned into a barracks. At midnight General Jose Raquel Moncada was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sentenced to death. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, in spite of the violent recriminations of Ursula, </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">81 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">refused to commute the sentence. A short while before dawn he visited the condemned man in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room used as a cell. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Remember, old friend,&rdquo; he told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not shooting you. It&rsquo;s the revolution that&rsquo;s shooting </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">^ ?? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">General Moncada did not even get up from the cot when he saw him come in. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go to hell, friend,&rdquo; he answered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until that moment, ever since his return. Colonel Aureliano Buendia had not given himself the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opportunity to see him with his heart. He was startled to see how much he had aged, how his hands </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shook, and the rather punctilious conformity with which he awaited death, and then he felt a great </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disgust with himself, which he mingled with the beginnings of pity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know better than I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that all courts-martial are farces and that you&rsquo;re really paying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for the crimes of other people, because this time we&rsquo;re going to win the war at any price. Wouldn&rsquo;t </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you have done the same in my place?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">General Moncada, got up to clean his thick horn-rimmed glasses on his shirttail. &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said. &ldquo;But what worries me is not your shooting me, because after all, for people like us it&rsquo;s a natural </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death.&rdquo; He laid his glasses on the bed and took off his watch and chain. &ldquo;What worries me,&rdquo; he went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on, &ldquo;is that out of so much hatred for the military, out of fighting them so much and thinking about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them so much, you&rsquo;ve ended up as bad as they are. And no ideal in life is worth that much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">baseness.&rdquo; He took off his wedding ring and the medal of the Virgin of Help and put them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">alongside his glasses and watch. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At this rate,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not only be the most despotic and bloody dictator in our </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">history, but you&rsquo;ll shoot my dear friend Ursula in an attempt to pacify your conscience.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia stood there impassively. General Moncada then gave him the glasses, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">medal, watch, and ring and he changed his tone. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t send for you to scold you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wanted to ask you the favor of sending these </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">things to my wife.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia put them in his pockets. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is she still in Manaure?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still in Manaure,&rdquo; General Moncada confirmed, &ldquo;in the same house behind the church </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where you sent the letter.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to, Jose Raquel,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he went out into the blue air of the mist his face grew damp as on some other dawn in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">past and only then did he realize that -he had ordered the sentence to be carried out in the courtyard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and not at the cemetery wall. The firing squad, drawn up opposite the door, paid him the honors of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a head of state. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They can bring him out now,&rdquo; he ordered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">82 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 9 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">COLONEL GERINELDO MARQUEZ was the first to perceive the emptiness of the war. In his position </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as civil and military leader of Macondo he would have telegraphic conversations twice a week with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia. At first those exchanges would determine the course of a flesh-and- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">blood war, the perfectly defined outlines of which told them at any moment the exact spot -where it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was and the prediction of its future direction. Although he never let himself be pulled into the area </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of confidences, not even by his closest friends. Colonel Aureliano Buendia still had at that time the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">familiar tone that made it possible to identify him at the other end of the wire. Many times he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prolong the talk beyond the expected limit and let them drift into comments of a domestic nature. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Little by little, however, and as the war became more intense and widespread, his image was fading </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">away into a universe of unreality. The characteristics of his speech were more and more uncertain, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and they cam together and combined to form words that were gradually losing all meaning. Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo Marquez limited himself then to just listening, burdened by the impression that he was in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">telegraphic contact with a stranger from another world. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand, Aureliano,&rdquo; he would conclude on the key. &ldquo;Long live the Liberal party!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He finally lost all contact with the war. What in other times had been a real activity, an irresistible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passion of his youth, became a remote point of reference for him: an emptiness. His only refuge was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta&rsquo;s sewing room. He would visit her every afternoon. He liked to watch her hands as she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">curled frothy petticoat cloth in the machine that was kept in motion by Remedios the Beauty. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spent many hours without speaking, content with their reciprocal company, but while Amaranta was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inwardly pleased in keeping the fire of his devotion alive, he was unaware of the secret designs of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that indecipherable heart. When the news of his return reached her, Amaranta had been smothered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by anxiety. But when she saw him enter the house in the middle of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">noisy escort and she saw how he had been mistreated by the rigors of exile, made old by age and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">oblivion, dirty with sweat and dust, smelling like a herd, ugly, with his left arm in a sling, she felt </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">faint with disillusionment. &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t the person I was waiting for.&rdquo; On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the following day, however, he came back to the house shaved and clean, with his mustache </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perfumed with lavender water and without the bloody sling. He brought her a prayerbook bound in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mother-of-pearl. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How strange men are,&rdquo; she said, because she could not think of anything else to say. &ldquo;They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spend their lives fighting against priests and then give prayerbooks as gifts.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that time on, even during the most critical days of the war, he visited her every afternoon. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many times, when Remedios the Beauty was not present, it was he who turned the wheel on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sewing machine. Amaranta felt upset by the perseverance, the loyalty, the submissiveness of that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man who was invested with so much authority and who nevertheless took off his sidearm in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">living room so that he could go into the sewing room without weapons. But for four years he kept </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">repeating his love and she would always find a way to reject him without hurting him, for even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">though she had not succeeded in loving him she could no longer live without him. Remedios the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beauty, who seemed indifferent to everything and who was thought to be mentally retarded, was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insensitive to so much devotion and she intervened in Colonel Gerineldo Marquez&rsquo;s favor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta suddenly discovered that the girl she had raised, who was just entering adolescence, was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">already the most beautiful creature that had even been seen in Macondo. She felt reborn in her heart </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the rancor that she had felt in other days for Rebeca, and begging God not to impel her into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">extreme state of wishing her dead, she banished her from the sewing room. It was around that time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez began to feel the boredom of the war. He summoned Inis reserves </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">83 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of persuasion, his broad and repressed tenderness, ready to give up for Amaranta a glory that had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cost him the sacrifice of his best years. But he could not succeed in convincing her. One August </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">afternoon, overcome by the unbearable weight of her own obstinacy, Amaranta locked herself in her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom to weep over her solitude unto death after giving her final answer to her tenacious suitor: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget about each other forever,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re too old for this sort of thing now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had a telegraphic call from Colonel Aureliano Buendia that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">afternoon. It was a routine conversation which was not going to bring about any break in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stagnant war. At the end, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez looked at the desolate streets, the crystal water </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the almond trees, and he found himself lost in solitude. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aureliano,&rdquo; he said sadly on the key, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s raining in Macondo.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a long silence on the line. Suddenly the apparatus jumped with the pitiless letters from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a jackass, Gerineldo,&rdquo; the signals said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural for it to be raining in August.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had not seen each other for such a long time that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was upset by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the aggressiveness of the reaction. Two months later, however, when Colonel Aureliano Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returned to Macondo, his upset was changed to stupefaction. Even Ursula was surprised at how </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much he had changed. He came with no noise, no escort, wrapped in a cloak in spite of the heat, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and with three mistresses, whom he installed in the same house, where he spent most of his time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lying in a hammock. He scarcely read the telegraphic dispatches that reported routine operations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On one occasion Colonel Gerineldo Marquez asked him for instructions for the evacuation of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spot on the border where there was a danger that the conflict would become an international affair. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me with trifles,&rdquo; he ordered him. &ldquo;Consult Divine Providence.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was perhaps the most critical moment of the war. The Liberal landowners, who had supported </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the revolution in the beginning, had made secret alliances with the Conservative landowners in order </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to stop the revision of property titles. The politicians who supplied funds for the war from exile had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Publicly repudiated the drastic aims of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, but even that withdrawal of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">authorization did not seem to bother him. He had not returned to reading his poetry, which filled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more than five volumes and lay forgotten at the bottom of Inis trunk. At night or at siesta time he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would call one of his women to his hammock and obtain a rudimentary satisfaction from her, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then he would sleep like a stone that was not concerned by the slightest indication of worry. Only he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew at that time that his confused heart was condemned to uncertainty forever. At first, intoxicated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the glory of his return, by his remarkable victories, he had peeped into the abyss of greatness. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took pleasure in keeping by his right hand the Duke of Marlborough, his great teacher in the art of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">war, whose attire of skins and tiger claws aroused the respect of adults and the awe of children. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was then that he decided that no human being, not even Ursula, could come closer to him than ten </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feet. In the center of the chalk circle that his aides would draw wherever he stopped, and which only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he could enter, he would decide with brief orders that had no appeal the fate of the world. The first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time that he was in Manaure after the shooting of General Moncada, he hastened to fulfill his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">victim&rsquo;s last wish and the widow took the glasses, the medal, the watch, and the ring, but she would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not let him in the door. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in, colonel,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;You may be in command of your war, but I&rsquo;m in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">command of my house.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not show any sign of anger, but his spirit only calmed down when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his bodyguard had sacked the widow&rsquo;s house and reduced it to ashes. &ldquo;Watch out for your heart, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano,&rdquo; Colonel Gerineldo Marquez would say to him then. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rotting alive.&rdquo; About that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time he called together a second assembly of the principal rebel commanders. He found all types: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">idealists, ambitious people, adventurers, those with social resentments, even common criminals. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was even a former Conservative functionary who had taken refuge in the revolt to escape a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">84 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">judgment for misappropriation of funds. Many of them did not even know why they were fighting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the midst of that motley crowd, whose differences of values were on the verge of causing an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">internal explosion, one gloomy authority stood out: General Te6filo Vargas. He was a full-blooded </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indian, untamed, illiterate, and endowed with quiet wiles and a messianic vocation that aroused a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">demented fanaticism in his men. Colonel Aureliano Buendia called the meeting with the aim of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unifying the rebel command against the maneuvers of the politicians. General Teofilo Vargas came </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forward with his intentions: in a few hours he shattered the coalition of better-qualified commanders </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and took charge of the main command. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wild beast worth watching,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia told his officers. &ldquo;That man is more dangerous to us than the Minister of War.&rdquo; Then a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very young captain who had always been outstanding for his timidity raised a cautious index finger. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite simple, colonel,&rdquo; he proposed. &ldquo;He has to be killed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia was not alarmed by the coldness of the proposition but by the way in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which, by a fraction of a second, it had anticipated his own thoughts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect me to give an order like that,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not give it, as a matter of fact. But two weeks later General Teofilo Vargas was cut to bits </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by machetes in an ambush and Colonel Aureliano Buendia assumed the main command. The same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night that his authority was recognized by all the rebel commands, he woke up in a fright, calling for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a blanket. An inner coldness which shattered his bones and tortured him even in the heat of the sun </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would not let him sleep for several months, until it became a habit. The intoxication of power began </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to break apart under waves of discomfort. Searching for a cure against the chill, he had the young </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officer who had proposed the murder of General Teofilo Vargas shot. His orders were being carried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out even before they were given, even before he thought of them, and they always went much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beyond what he would have dared have them do. Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to lose direction. He was bothered by the people who cheered him in neighboring villages, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he imagined that they were the same cheers they gave the enemy. Everywhere he met </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">adolescents who looked at him with his own eyes, who spoke to him with his own voice, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">greeted him with the same mistrust with which he greeted them, and who said they were his sons. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He felt scattered about, multiplied, and more solitary than ever. He was convinced that his own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officers were lying to him. He fought with the Duke of Marlborough. &ldquo;The best friend a person </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">has,&rdquo; he would say at that time, &ldquo;is one who has just died.&rdquo; He was weary of the uncertainty, of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vicious circle of that eternal war that always found him in the same place, but always older, wearier, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even more in the position of not knowing why, or how, or even when. There was always someone </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">outside of the chalk circle. Someone who needed money, someone who had a son with whooping </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cough, or someone who wanted to go off and sleep forever because he could not stand the shit taste </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the war in his mouth and who, nevertheless, stood at attention to inform him: &ldquo;Everything </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">normal, colonel.&rdquo; And normality was precisely the most fearful part of that infinite war: nothing ever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">happened. Alone, abandoned by his premonitions, fleeing the chill that was to accompany him until </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death, he sought a last refuge in Macondo in the warmth of his oldest memories. His indolence was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so serious that when they announced the arrival of a commission from his party that was authorized </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to discuss the stalemate of the war, he rolled over in his hammock without completely waking up. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take them to the whores,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were six lawyers in frock coats and top hats who endured the violent November sun with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stiff stoicism. Ursula put them up in her house. They spent the greater part of the day closeted in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom in hermetic conferences and at dusk they asked for an escort and some accordion players </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and took over Catarino&rsquo;s store. &ldquo;Leave them alone,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia ordered. &ldquo;After all, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know what they want.&rdquo; At the beginning of December the long-awaited interview, which many had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreseen as an interminable argument, was resolved in less than an hour. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">85 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the hot parlor, beside the specter of the pianola shrouded in a white sheet, Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia did not sit down that time inside the chalk circle that his aides had drawn. He sat in a chair </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">between his political advisers and, wrapped in his woolen blanket, he listened in silence to the brief </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proposals of the emissaries. They asked first that he renounce the revision of property titles in order </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to get back the support of the Liberal landowners. They asked, secondly, that he renounce the fight </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">against clerical influence in order to obtain the support of the Catholic masses. They asked, finally, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he renounce the aim of equal rights for natural and illegitimate children in order to preserve the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">integrity of the home. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That means,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, smiling when the reading was over, &ldquo;that all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we&rsquo;re fighting for is power.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tactical changes,&rdquo; one of the delegates replied. &ldquo;Right now the main thing is to broaden </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the popular base of the war. Then we&rsquo;ll have another look.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of Colonel Aureliano Buendla&rsquo;s political advisers hastened to intervene. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a contradiction&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If these changes are good, it means that the Conservative regime </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">is good. If we succeed in broadening the popular base of the war with them, as you people say, it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">means that the regime his a broad popular base. It means, in short, that for almost twenty years </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we&rsquo;ve been fighting against the sentiments of the nation.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was going to go on, but Colonel Aureliano Buendia stopped him with a signal. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">your time, doctor.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The important thing is that from now on we&rsquo;ll be fighting only for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">power.&rdquo; Still smiling, he took the documents the delegates gave him and made ready to sign them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the way it is,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;we have no objection to accepting.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His men looked at one another in consternation. &ldquo;Excuse me, colonel,&rdquo; Colonel Gerineldo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marquez said softly, &ldquo;but this is a betrayal.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia held the inked pen in the air and discharged the whole weight of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">authority on him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surrender your weapons,&rdquo; he ordered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez stood up and put his sidearms on the table. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Report to the barracks,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia ordered him. &ldquo;Put yourself at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disposition of the revolutionary court.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he signed the declaration and gave the sheets of paper to the emissaries, saying to them: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here an your papers, gentlemen. I hope you can get some advantage out of them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two days later. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, accused of high treason, was condemned to death. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lying in his hammock, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was insensible to the pleas for clemency. On the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eve of the execution, disobeying the order not to bother him, Ursula visited him in his bedroom. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Encased in black, invested with a rare solemnity, she stood during the three minutes of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interview. &ldquo;I know that you&rsquo;re going to shoot Gerineldo,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;and that I can&rsquo;t do </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anything to stop it. But I give you one warning: as soon as I see his body I swear to you by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bones of my father and mother, by the memory of Jose Arcadio Buendia, I swear to you before God </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that I will drag you out from wherever you&rsquo;re hiding and kill you with my own two hands.&rdquo; Before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leaving the room, without waiting for any reply, she concluded: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as if you&rsquo;d been born with the tail of a pig.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During that interminable night while Colonel Gerineldo Marquez thought about his dead </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">afternoons in Amaranta&rsquo;s sewing room. Colonel Aureliano Buendia scratched for many hours trying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to break the hard shell of his solitude. His only happy moments, since that remote afternoon when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his father had taken him to see ice, had taken place in his silver workshop where he passed the time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">putting little gold fishes together. He had had to start thirty-two wars and had had to violate all of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his pacts with death and wallow like a hog in the dungheap of glory in order to discover the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">privileges of simplicity almost forty years late. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">86 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At dawn, worn out by the tormented vigil, he appeared in the cell an hour before the execution. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The farce is over, old friend,&rdquo; he said to Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the mosquitoes in here execute you.&rdquo; Colonel Gerineldo Marquez could not repress the disdain that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was inspired in him by that attitude. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Aureliano,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be dead than see you changed into a bloody tyrant.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see me,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia said. &ldquo;Put on your shoes and help me get this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shitty war over with.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he said it he did not know that it was easier to start a war than to end one. It took him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost a year of fierce and bloody effort to force the government to propose conditions of peace </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">favorable to the rebels and another year to convince his own partisans of the convenience of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accepting them. He went to inconceivable extremes of cruelty to put down the rebellion of his own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officers, who resisted and called for victory, and he finally relied on enemy forces to make them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">submit. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was never a greater soldier than at that time. The certainty that he was finally fighting for his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">own liberation and not for abstract ideals, for slogans that politicians could twist left and right </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">according to the circumstances, filled him with an ardent enthusiasm. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who fought for defeat with as much conviction and loyalty as he had previously fought for victory, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reproached him for his useless temerity. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he would say, smiling. &ldquo;Dying is much more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">difficult than one imagines.&rdquo; In his case it was tme. The certainty that his day was assigned gave him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a mysterious immunity, an immortality or a fixed period that made him invulnerable to the risks of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">war and in the end permitted him to win a defeat that was much more difficult, much more bloody </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and costly than victory. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In almost twenty years of war. Colonel Aureliano Buendia had been at his house many times, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the state of urgency with which he always arrived, the military retinue that accompanied him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everywhere, the aura of legend that glowed about his presence and of which even Ursula was aware, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">changed him into a stranger in the end. The last time that he was in Macondo and took a house for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his three concubines, he was seen in his own house only on two or three occasions when he had the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time to accept an invitation to dine. Remedios the Beauty and the twins, born during the middle of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the war, scarcely knew him. Amaranta could not reconcile her image of the brother who had spent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his adolescence making little gold fishes with that of the mythical warrior who had placed a distance </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of ten feet between himself and the rest of humanity. But when the approach of the armistice </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">became known and they thought that he would return changed back into a human being, delivered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at last for the hearts of his own people, the family feelings, dormant for such a long time, were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reborn stronger than ever. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll finally have a man in the house again,&rdquo; Ursula said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta was the first to suspect that they had lost him forever. One week before the armistice, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he entered the house without an escort, preceded by two barefoot orderlies who deposited on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the porch the saddle from the mule and the tmnk of poetry, all that was left of his former imperial </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">baggage, she saw him pass by the sewing room and she called to him. Colonel Aureliano Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had trouble recognizing her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Amaranta,&rdquo; she said good-humoredly, happy at his return, and she showed him the hand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the black bandage. &ldquo;Look.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia smiled at her the same way as when he had first seen her with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bandage on that remote morning when he had come back to Macondo condemned to death. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How awful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the way time passes!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The regular army had to protect the house. He arrived amid insults, spat upon, accused of having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accelerated the war in order to sell it for a better price. He was trembling with fever and cold and his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armpits were studded with sores again. Six months before, when she had heard talk about the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">87 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armistice, Ursula had opened up and swept out the bridal chamber and had burned myrrh in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">corners, thinking that he would come back ready to grow old slowly among Remedios&rsquo; musty dolls. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But actually, during the last two years he had paid his final dues to life, including growing old. When </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he passed by the silver shop, which Ursula had prepared with special diligence, he did not even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">notice that the keys were in the lock. He did not notice the minute, tearing destruction that time had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wreaked on the house and that, after such a prolonged absence, would have looked like a disaster to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">any man who had kept his memories alive. He was not pained by the peeling of the whitewash on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the walls or the dirty, cottony cobwebs in the corners or the dust on the begonias or the veins left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the beams by the termites or the moss on the hinges or any of the insidious traps that nostalgia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">offered him. He sat down on the porch, wrapped in his blanket and with his boots still on, as if only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting for it to clear, and he spent the whole afternoon watching it rain on the begonias. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understood then that they would not have him home for long. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not the war,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">can only be death.&rdquo; It was a supposition that was so neat, so convincing that she identified it as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">premonition. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night, at dinner, the supposed Aureliano Segundo broke his bread with his right hand and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drank his soup with his left. His twin brother, the supposed Jose Arcadio Segundo, broke his bread </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with his left hand and drank his soup with his right. So precise was their coordination that they did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not look like two brothers sitting opposite each other but like a trick with mirrors. The spectacle that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the twins had invented when they became aware that they were equal was repeated in honor of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">new arrival. But Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not notice it. He seemed so alien to everything that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he did not even notice Remedios the Beauty as she passed by naked on her way to her bedroom. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was the only one who dared disturb Iris, abstraction. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you have to go away again,&rdquo; she said halfway through dinner, &ldquo;at least try to remember how </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we were tonight.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Colonel Aureliano Buendia realized, without surprise, that Ursula was the only human </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being who had succeeded in penetrating his misery, and for the first time in many years he looked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her in the face. Her skin was leathery, her teeth decayed, her hair faded and colorless, and her look </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frightened. He compared her with the oldest memory that he had of her, the afternoon when he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the premonition that a pot of boiling soup was going to fall off the table, and he found her broken </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to pieces. In an instant he discovered the scratches, the welts, the sores, the ulcers, and the scan that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been left on her by more than half a century of daily life, and he saw that those damages did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even arouse a feeling of pity in him. Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where his affection had rotted away and he could not find it. On another occasion, he felt at least a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confused sense of shame when he found the smell of Ursula on his own skin, and more than once </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he felt her thoughts interfering with his. But all of that had been wiped out by the war. Even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios, his wife, at that moment was a hazy image of someone who might have been his daugh&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ter. The countless women he had known on the desert of love and who had spread his seed all along </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the coast had left no trace in his feelings. Most of them had come into his room in the dark and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">left before dawn, and on the following day they were nothing but a touch of fatigue in his bodily </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memory. The only affection that prevailed against time and the war was that which he had felt for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his brother Jose Arcadio when they both were children, and it was not based on love but on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complicity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he excused himself from Ursula&rsquo;s request. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the war has done away with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the following days he busied himself destroying all trace of his passage through the world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He stripped the silver shop until all that were left were impersonal objects, he gave his clothes away </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the orderlies, and he buried his weapons in the courtyard with the same feeling of penance with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which his father had buried the spear that had killed Prudencio Aguilar. He kept only one pistol with </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">88 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one bullet in it. Ursula did not intervene. The only time she dissuaded him was when he was about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to destroy the daguerreotype of Remedios that was kept in the parlor lighted by an eternal lamp. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That picture stopped belonging to you a long time ago,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a family relic.&rdquo; On the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eve of the armistice, when no single object that would let him be remembered was left in the house, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he took the trunk of poetry to the bakery when Santa Sofia de la Piedad was making ready to light </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the oven. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Light it with this,&rdquo; he told her, handing her the first roll of yellowish papers. &ldquo;It will, burn better </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because they&rsquo;re very old things.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Santa Sofia de la Piedad, the silent one, the condescending one, the one who never contradicted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anyone, not even her own children, had the impression that it was a forbidden act. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re important papers,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; the colonel said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re things that a person writes to himself.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you burn them, colonel.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He not only did that, but he broke up the trunk with a hatchet and threw the pieces into the fire. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hours before, Pilar Ternera had come to visit him. After so many years of not seeing her, Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendfa was startled at how old and fat she had become and how much she had lost of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the splendor of her laugh, but he was also startled at the depths she had reached in her reading of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the cards. &ldquo;Watch out for your mouth,&rdquo; she told him, and he wondered whether the other time she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had told him that during the height of his glory it had not been a surprisingly anticipated vision of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his fate. A short time later, when his personal physician finished removing his sores, he asked him, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without showing any particular interest, where the exact location of his heart was. The doctor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">listened with his stethoscope and then painted a circle on his cheat with a piece of cotton dipped in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">iodine. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Tuesday of the armistice dawned warm and rainy. Colonel Aureliano Buendia appeared in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the kitchen before five o&rsquo;clock and had his usual black coffee without sugar. &ldquo;You came into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">world on a day like this,&rdquo; Ursula told him. &ldquo;Everybody was amazed at your open eyes.&rdquo; He did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pay any attention because he was listening to the forming of the troops, the sound of the comets, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the voices of command that were shattering the dawn. Even though after so many years of war </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they should have sounded familiar to him this time he felt the same weakness in his knees and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same tingling in his skin that he had felt in his youth in the presence of a naked woman. He thought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confusedly, finally captive in a trap of nostalgia, that perhaps if he had married her he would have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been a man without war and without glory, a nameless artisan, a happy animal. That tardy shudder </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which had not figured in his forethought made his breakfast bitter. At seven in the morning, when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez came to fetch him, in the company of a group of rebel officers, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found him more taciturn than ever, more pensive and solitary. Ursula tried to throw a new wrap </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over his shoulders. &ldquo;What will the government think,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll figure that you&rsquo;ve </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surrendered because you didn&rsquo;t have anything left to buy a cloak with.&rdquo; But he would not accept it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he was at the door, he let her put an old felt hat of Jose Arcadio Buendia&rsquo;s on his head. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aureliano,&rdquo; Ursula said to him then, &ldquo;Promise me that if you find that it&rsquo;s a bad hour for you </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there that you&rsquo;ll think of your mother.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He gave her a distant smile, raising his hand with all his fingers extended, and without saying a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">word he left the house and faced the shouts, insults, and blasphemies that would follow him until he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">left the town. Ursula put the bar on the door, having decided not to take it down for the rest of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">life. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rot in here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn to ashes in this house without men, but we won&rsquo;t </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">give this miserable town the pleasure of seeing us weep.&rdquo; She spent the whole morning looking for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memory of her son in the most hidden corners, but she could find none. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ceremony took place fifteen miles from Macondo in the shade of a gigantic ceiba tree around </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which the town of Neerlandia would be founded later. The delegates from the government and the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">89 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">party and the commission of the rebels who were laying down their arms were served by a noisy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">group of novices in white habits who looked like a flock of doves that had been frightened by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rain. Colonel Aureliano Buendia arrived on a muddy mule. He had not shaved, more tormented by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the pain of the sores than by the great failure of his dreams, for he had reached the end of all hope, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beyond glory and the nostalgia of glory. In accordance with his arrangements there was no music, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no fireworks, no pealing bells, no shouts of victory, or any other manifestation that might alter the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mournful character of the armistice. An itinerant photographer who took the only picture of him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that could have been preserved was forced to smash his plates without developing them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ceremony lasted only the time necessary to sign the documents. Around the rustic table </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">placed in the center of a patched circus tent where the delegates sat were the last officers who were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">faithful to Colonel Aureliano Buendia. Before taking the signatures, the personal delegate of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">president of the republic tried to read the act of surrender aloud, but Colonel Aureliano Buendia was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">against it. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not waste time on formalities,&rdquo; he said and prepared to sign the papers without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reading them. One of his officers then broke the soporific silence of the tent. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please do us the favor of not being the first to sign.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia acceded. When the documents went all around the table, in the midst </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a silence that was so pure that one could have deciphered the signatures from the scratching of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the pen on the paper, the first line was still blank. Colonel Aureliano Buendia prepared to fill it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; another of his officers said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s still time for everything to come out right.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without changing his expression, Colonel Aureliano Buendia signed the first copy. He had not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finished signing the last one when a rebel colonel appeared in the doorway leading a mule carrying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two chests. In spite of his entire youth he had a dry look and a patient expression. He was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">treasurer of the revolution in the Macondo region. He had made a difficult journey of six days, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pulling along the mule, who was dying of hunger, in order to arrive at the armistice on time. With an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exasperating parsimony he took down the chests, opened them, and placed on the table, one by one, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seventy-two gold bricks, Everyone had forgotten about the existence of that fortune. In the disorder </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the past year, when the central command fell apart and the revolution degenerated into a bloody </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rivalry of leaders, it was impossible to determine any responsibility. The gold of the revolution, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">melted into blocks that were then covered with baked clay, was beyond all control. Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia had the seventy-two gold bricks included in the inventory of surrender and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">closed the ceremony without allowing any speeches. The filthy adolescent stood opposite him, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looking into his eyes with his own calm, syrup-colored eyes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Something else?&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia asked him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young colonel tightened his mouth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The receipt,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia wrote it out in his own hand. Then he had a glass of lemonade and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">piece of biscuit that the novices were passing around and retired to a field tent which had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prepared for him in case he wished to rest. There he took off his shirt, sat on the edge of the cot, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and at three-fifteen in the afternoon took his pistol and shot himself in the iodine circle that his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">personal physician had painted on his chest. At that moment in Macondo Ursula took the cover off </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the pot of milk on the stove, wondering why it was taking so long to boil, and found it full of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worms. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve killed Aureliano,&rdquo; she exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked toward the courtyard, obeying a habit of her solitude, and then she saw Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia, soaking wet and sad in the rain and much older than when he had died. &ldquo;They shot him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the back,&rdquo; Ursula said more precisely, &ldquo;and no one was charitable enough to close his eyes.&rdquo; At dusk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through her tears she saw the swift and luminous disks that crossed the sky like an exhalation and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she thought that it was a signal of death. She was still under the chestnut tree, sobbing at her </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">90 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband&rsquo;s knees, when they brought in Colonel Aureliano Buendla, wrapped in a blanket that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stiff with dry blood and with his eyes open in rage. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was out of danger. The bullet had followed such a neat path that the doctor was able to put a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cord soaked in iodine in through the chest and withdraw it from the back. &ldquo;That was my </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">masterpiece,&rdquo; he said with satisfaction. &ldquo;It was the only point where a bullet could pass through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without harming any vital organ.&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendla saw himself surrounded by charitable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">novices who intoned desperate psalms for the repose of his soul and then he was sorry that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not shot himself in the roof of the mouth as he had considered doing if only to mock the prediction </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Pilar Ternera. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I still had the authority,&rdquo; he told the doctor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you shot out of hand. Not for having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saved my life but for having made a fool of me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The failure of his death brought back his lost prestige in a few hours. The same people who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invented the story that he had sold the war for a room with walls made of gold bricks defined the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attempt at suicide as an act of honor and proclaimed him a martyr. Then, when he rejected the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Order of Merit awarded him by the president of the republic, even his most bitter enemies filed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the room asking him to withdraw recognition of the armistice and to start a new war. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house was filled with gifts meant as amends. Impressed finally by the massive support of his former </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">comrades in arms. Colonel Aureliano Buendla did not put aside the possibility of pleasing them. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the contrary, at a certain moment he seemed so enthusiastic with the idea of a new war that Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo Marquez thought that he was only waiting for a pretext to proclaim it. The pretext was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">offered, in fact, when the president of the republic refused to award any military pensions to former </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">combatants, Liberal or Conservative, until each case was examined by a special commission and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">award approved by the congress. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an outrage,&rdquo; thundered Colonel Aureliano Buendla. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll die of old age waiting for the mail to come.&rdquo; For the first time he left the rocker that Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had bought for his convalescence, and, walking about the bedroom, he dictated a strong message to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the president of the republic. In that telegram which was never made public, he denounced the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">violation of the Treaty of Neerlandia and threatened to proclaim war to the death if the assignment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of pensions was not resolved within two weeks. His attitude was so just that it allowed him to hope </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even for the support of former Conservative combatants. But the only reply from the government </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was the reinforcement of the military guard that had been placed at the door of his house with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pretext of protecting him, and the prohibition of all types of visits. Similar methods were adopted all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the country with other leaders who bore watching. It was an operation that was so timely, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drastic, and effective that two months after the armistice, when Colonel Aureliano Buendla had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recovered, his most dedicated conspirators were dead or exiled or had been assimilated forever into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">public administration. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendla left his room in December and it was sufficient for him to look at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">porch in order not to think about war again. With a vitality that seemed impossible at her age, Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had rejuvenated the house again. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re going to see who I am,&rdquo; she said when she saw that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her son was going to live. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be a better, more open house in all the world than this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">madhouse.&rdquo; She had it washed and painted, changed the furniture, restored the garden and planted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">new flowers, and opened doors and windows so that the dazzling light of summer would penetrate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even into the bedrooms. She decreed an end to the numerous superimposed periods of mourning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she herself exchanged her rigorous old gowns for youthful clothing. The music of the pianola </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again made the house merry. When she heard it, Amaranta thought of Pietro Crespi, his evening </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gardenia, and his smell of lavender, and in the depths of her withered heart a clean rancor flourished, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">purified by time. One afternoon when she was trying to put the parlor in order, Ursula asked for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">help of the soldiers who were guarding the house. The young commander of the guard gave them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">permission. Little by little, Ursula began assigning them new chores.

When the government withdrew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the guard, one of them continued living in the house and was in her service for many years. On New </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Year&rsquo;s Day, driven mad by rebuffs from Remedios the Beauty, the young commander of the guard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was found dead under her window. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">92 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 10 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YEARS LATER on his deathbed Aureliano Segundo would remember the rainy afternoon in June </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he went into the bedroom to meet his first son. Even though the child was languid and weepy, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with no mark of a Buendia, he did not have to think twice about naming him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call him Jose Arcadio,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman he had married the year before, agreed. Ursula, on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other hand, could not conceal a vague feeling of doubt. Throughout the long history of the family </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the insistent repetition of names had made her draw some conclusions that seemed to be certain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the Aurelianos were withdrawn, but with lucid minds, the Jose Arcadios were impulsive and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enterprising, but they were marked with a tragic sign. The only cases that were impossible to classify </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were those of Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo. They were so much alike and so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mischievous during childhood that not even Santa Sofia de la Piedad could tell them apart. On the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day of their christening Amaranta put bracelets on them with their respective names and dressed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them in different colored clothing marked with each one&rsquo;s initials, but when they began to go to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">school they decided to exchange clothing and bracelets and call each other by opposite names. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">teacher, Melchor Escalona, used to knowing Jose Arcadio Segundo by his green shirt, went out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his mind when he discovered that the latter was wearing Aureliano Segundo&rsquo;s bracelet and that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other one said, nevertheless, that his name was Aureliano Segundo in spite of the fact that he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wearing the white shirt and the bracelet with Jose Arcadio Segundo&rsquo;s name. From then on he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">never sure who was who. Even when they grew up and life made them different. Ursula still </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wondered if they themselves might not have made a mistake in some moment of their intricate game </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of confusion and had become changed forever. Until the beginning of adolescence they were two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">synchronized machines. They would wake up at the same time, have the urge to go to the bathroom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at the same time, suffer the same upsets in health, and they even dreamed about the same things. In </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house, where it was thought that they coordinated their actions with a simple desire to confuse, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no one realized what really was happening until one day when Santa Sofia de la Piedad gave one of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them a glass of lemonade and as soon as he tasted it the other one said that it needed sugar. Santa </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sofia de la Piedad, who had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemonade, told Ursula about it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re all like,&rdquo; she said without surprise, &ldquo;crazy from birth.&rdquo; In time things became </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">less disordered. The one who came out of the game of confusion with the name of Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo grew to monumental size like his grandfathers, and the one who kept the name of Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo grew to be bony like the colonel, and the only thing they had in common was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">family&rsquo;s solitary air. Perhaps it was that crossing of stature, names, and character that made Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suspect that they had been shuffled like a deck of cards since childhood. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The decisive difference was revealed in the midst of the war, when Jose Arcadio Segundo asked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Gerineldo Marquez to let him see an execution. Against Ursula&rsquo;s better judgment his wishes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were satisfied. Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, shuddered at the mere idea of witnessing an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">execution. He preferred to stay home. At the age of twelve he asked Ursula what was in the locked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room. &ldquo;Papers,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Melquiades&rsquo; books and the strange tilings that he wrote in his last </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">years.&rdquo; Instead of calming him, the answer increased his curiosity. He demanded so much, promised </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with such insistence that he would not mistreat the things, that Ursula, gave him the keys. No one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had gone into the room again since they had taken Melquiades&rsquo; body out and had put on the door a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">padlock whose parts had become fused together with rust. But when Aureliano Segundo opened the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">windows a familiar light entered that seemed accustomed to lighting the room every day and there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was not the slightest trace of dust or cobwebs, with everything swept and clean, better swept and </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">93 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cleaner than on the day of the burial, and the ink had not dried up in the inkwell nor had oxidation </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">diminished the shine of the metals nor had the embers gone out under the water pipe where Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia had vaporized mercury. On the shelves were the books bound in a cardboard-like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">material, pale, like tanned human skin, and the manuscripts were intact. In spite of the room&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">having been shut up for many years, the air seemed fresher than in the rest of the house. Everything </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was so recent that several weeks later, when Ursula went into the room with a pail of water and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brush to wash the floor, there was nothing for her to do. Aureliano Segundo was deep in the reading </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a book. Although it had no cover and the title did not appear anywhere, the boy enjoyed the story </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a woman who sat at a table and ate nothing but kernels of rice, which she picked up with a pin, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the story of the fisherman who borrowed a weight for his net from a neighbor and when he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave him a fish in payment later it had a diamond in its stomach, and the one about the lamp that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fulfilled wishes and about flying carpets. Surprised, he asked Ursula if all that was true and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">answered him that it was, that many years ago the gypsies had brought magic lamps and flying mats </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to Macondo. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;is that the world is slowly coming to an end and those things </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t come here any more.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he finished the book, in which many of the stories had no endings because there were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pages missing, Aureliano Segundo set about deciphering the manuscripts. It was impossible. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letters looked like clothes hung out to dry on a line and they looked more like musical notation than </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">writing. One hot noontime, while he was poring over the, manuscripts, he sensed that he was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">alone in the room. Against the light from the window, sitting with his hands on Inis knees, was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades. He was under forty years of age. He was wearing the same old-fashioned vest and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hat that looked like a raven&rsquo;s wings, and across Inis pale temples there flowed the grease from his hair </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that had been melted by the heat, just as Aureliano and Jose Arcadio had seen him when they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children. Aureliano Segundo recognized him at once, because that hereditary memory had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">transmitted from generation to generation and had come to him through the memory of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandfather. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, young man,&rdquo; said Melquiades. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From then on, for several years, they saw each other almost every afternoon. Melquiades talked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to him about the world, tried to infuse him with his old wisdom, but he refused to translate the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manuscripts. &ldquo;No one must know their meaning until he has reached one hundred years of age,&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">explained. Aureliano kept those meetings secret forever. On one occasion he felt that his private </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">world had fallen apart because Ursula came in when Melquiades was in the room. But she did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">see him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who were you talking to?&rdquo; she asked him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what your great-grandfather did,&rdquo; Ursula, said. &ldquo;He used to talk to himself too.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo, in the meantime, had satisfied his wish to see a shooting. For the rest of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his life he would remember the livid flash of the six simultaneous shots-and the echo of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discharge as it broke against the hills and the sad smile and perplexed eyes of the man being shot, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who stood erect while his shirt became soaked with blood, and who was still smiling even when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">untied him from the post and put him in a box filled with quicklime. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; he thought. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to bury him alive.&rdquo; It made such an impression on him that from then on he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">detested military practices and war, not because of the executions but because of the horrifying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">custom of burying the victims alive. No one knew then exactly when he began to ring the bells in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the church tower and assist Father Antonio Isabel, the successor to &ldquo;The Pup,&rdquo; at mass, and take </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">can of the fighting cocks in the courtyard of the parish house. When Colonel Gerineldo Marquez </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">94 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found out he scolded him strongly for learning occupations repudiated by the Liberals. &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he answered, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve turned out to be a Conservative.&rdquo; He believed it as if it had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">determined by fate. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, scandalized, told Ursula about it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that way,&rdquo; she approved. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope that he becomes a priest so that God will finally </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come into this house.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was soon discovered that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing him for his first communion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was teaching him the catechism as he shaved the necks of his roosters. He explained to him with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">simple examples, as he put the brooding hens into their nests, how it had occurred to God on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">second day of creation that chickens would be formed inside of an egg. From that time on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parish priest began to show the signs of senility that would lead him to say years later that the devil </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had probably won his rebellion against God, and that he was the one who sat on the heavenly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">throne, without revealing his true identity in order to trap the unwary. Warmed up by the persistence </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his mentor, in a few months Jose Arcadio Segundo came to be as adept in theological tricks used </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to confuse the devil as he was skilled in the tricks of the cockpit. Amaranta made him a linen suit </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a collar and tie, bought him a pair of white shoes, and engraved his name in gilt letters on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ribbon of the candle. Two nights before the first communion, Father Antonio Isabel closeted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself with him in the sacristy to hear his confession with the help of a dictionary of sins. It was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">such a long list that the aged priest, used to going to bed at six o&rsquo;clock, fell asleep in his chair before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it was over. The interrogation was a revelation for Jose Arcadio Segundo. It did not surprise him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the priest asked him if he had done bad things with women, and he honestly answered no, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was upset with the question as to whether he had done them with animals. The first Friday in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">May he received communion, tortured by curiosity. Later on he asked Petronio, the sickly sexton </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who lived in the belfry and who, according to what they said, fed himself on bats, about it, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petronio, answered him: &ldquo;There are some corrupt Christians who do their business with female </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">donkeys.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Segundo still showed so much curiosity and asked so many questions that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petronio lost his patience. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I go Tuesday nights,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;if you promise not to tell anyone I&rsquo;ll take you next </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, on the following Tuesday Petronio came down out of the tower with a wooden stool </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which until then no one had known the use of, and he took Jose Arcadio Segundo to a nearby </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pasture. The boy became so taken with those nocturnal raids that it was a long time before he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seen at Catarino&rsquo;s. He became a cockfight man. &ldquo;Take those creatures somewhere else,&rdquo; Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ordered him the first time she saw him come in with his fine fighting birds. &ldquo;Roosters have already </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought too much bitterness to this house for you to bring us any more.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took them away without any argument, but he continued breeding them at the house of Pilar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ternera, his grandmother, who gave him everything he needed in exchange for having him in her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house. He soon displayed in the cockpit the wisdom that Father Antonio Isabel had given him, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he made enough money not only to enrich Inis brood but also to look for a man&rsquo;s satisfactions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula compared him with his brother at that time and could not understand how the twins, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looked like the same person in childhood, had ended up so differently. Her perplexity did not last </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very long, for quite soon Aureliano Segundo began to show signs of laziness and dissipation. While </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was shut up in Melquiades&rsquo; room he was drawn into himself the way Colonel Aureliano Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been in his youth. But a short time after the Treaty of Neerlandia, a piece of chance took him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out of his withdrawn self and made him face the reality of the world. A young woman who was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">selling numbers for the raffle of an accordion greeted him with a great deal of familiarity. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo was not surprised, for he was frequently confused with his brother. But he did not clear up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the mistake, not even when the girl tried to soften his heart with sobs, and she ended taking him to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her room. She liked him so much from that first meeting that she fixed things so that he would win </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">95 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the accordion in the raffle. At the end of two weeks Aureliano Segundo realized that the woman had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been going to bed alternately with him and his brother, thinking that they were the same man, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">instead of making tilings clear, he arranged to prolong the situation. He did not return to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades&rsquo; room. He would spend his afternoons in the courtyard, learning to play the accordion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by ear over the protests of Ursula, who at that time had forbidden music in the house because of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mourning and who, in addition, despised the accordion as an instmment worthy only of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vagabond heirs of Francisco the Man. Nevertheless, Aureliano Segundo became a virtuoso on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accordion and he still was after he had married and had children and was one of the most respected </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">men in Macondo. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For almost two months he shared the woman with his brother. He would watch him, mix up his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plans, and when he was sure that Jose Arcadio Segundo was not going to visit their common </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mistress that night, he would go and sleep with her. One morning he found that he was sick. Two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days later he found his brother clinging to a beam in the bathroom, soaked in sweat and with tears </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pouring down, and then he understood. His brother confessed to him that the woman had sent him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">away because he had given her what she called a low-life sickness. He also told him how Pilar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ternera had tried to cure him. Aureliano Segundo submitted secretly to the burning baths of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">permanganate and to diuretic waters, and both were cured separately after three months of secret </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suffering. Jose Arcadio Segundo did not see the woman again. Aureliano Segundo obtained her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pardon and stayed with her until his death. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her name was Petra Cotes. She had arrived in Macondo in the middle of the war with a chalice </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband who lived off raffles, and when the man died she kept up the business. She was a clean </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">young mulatto woman with yellow almond-shaped eyes that gave her face the ferocity of a panther, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but she had a generous heart and a magnificent vocation for love. When Ursula realized that Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo was a cockfight man and that Aureliano Segundo played the accordion at his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concubine&rsquo;s noisy parties, she thought she would go mad with the combination. It was as if the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">defects of the family and none of the virtues had been concentrated in both. Then she decided that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no one again would be called Aureliano or Jose Arcadio. Yet when Aureliano Segundo had his first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">son she did not dare go against his will. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Ursula said, &ldquo;but on one condition: I will bring him up.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she was already a hundred years old and on the point of going blind from cataracts, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">still had her physical dynamism, her integrity of character, and her mental balance intact. No one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be better able than she to shape the virtuous man who would restore the prestige of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">family, a man who would never have heard talk of war, fighting cocks, bad women, or wild </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">undertakings, four calamities that, according to what Ursula thought, had determined the downfall, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of their line. &ldquo;This one will be a priest,&rdquo; she promised solemnly. &ldquo;And if God gives me life he&rsquo;ll be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pope someday.&rdquo; They all laughed when they heard her, not only in the bedroom but all through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house, where Aureliano Segundo&rsquo;s rowdy friends were gathered. The war, relegated to the attic of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bad memories, was momentarily recalled with the popping of champagne bottles. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To the health of the Pope,&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo toasted. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The guests toasted in a chorus. Then the man of the house played the accordion, fireworks were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">set off, and drums celebrated the event throughout the town. At dawn the guests, soaked in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">champagne, sacrificed six cows and put them in the street at the disposal of the crowd. No one was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scandalized. Since Aureliano Segundo had taken charge of the house those festivities were a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">common thing, even when there was no motive as proper as the birth of a Pope. In a few years, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without effort, simply by luck, he had accumulated one of the largest fortunes in the swamp thanks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the supernatural proliferation of his animals. His mares would bear triplets, his hens laid twice a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day, and his hogs fattened with such speed that no one could explain such disorderly fecundity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">except through the use of black magic. &ldquo;Save something now,&rdquo; Ursula would tell her wild great- </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">96 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandson. &ldquo;This luck is not going to last all your life.&rdquo; But Aureliano Segundo paid no attention to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her. The more he opened champagne to soak his friends, the more wildly his animals gave birth and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the more he was convinced that his lucky star was not a matter of his conduct but an influence of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petra Cotes, his concubine, whose love had the virtue of exasperating nature. So convinced was he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that this was the origin of his fortune that he never kept Petra Cotes far away from his breeding </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grounds and even when he married and had children he continued living with her with the consent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Fernanda. Solid, monumental like his grandfathers, but with a joie de vivre and an irresistible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">good humor that they did not have, Aureliano Segundo scarcely had time to look after his animals. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All he had to do was to take Petra Cores to his breeding grounds and have her ride across his land in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">order to have every animal marked with his brand succumb to the irremediable plague of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proliferation. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like all the good things that occurred in his long life, that tremendous fortune had its origins in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chance. Until the end of the wars Petra Cotes continued to support herself with the returns from her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">raffles and Aureliano Segundo was able to sack Ursula&rsquo;s savings from time to time. They were a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frivolous couple, with no other worries except going to bed every night, even on forbidden days, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and frolicking there until dawn. &ldquo;That woman has been your ruination,&rdquo; Ursula would shout at her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">great-grandson when she saw him coming into the house like a sleepwalker. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got you so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bewitched that one of these days Pm going to see you twisting around with colic and with a toad in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">your belly.&rdquo; Jose Arcadio Segundo, who took a long time to discover that he had been supplanted, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was unable to understand his brother&rsquo;s passion. He remembered Petra Cotes as an ordinary woman, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rather lazy in bed, and completely lacking in any resources for lovemaking. Deaf to Ursula&rsquo;s clamor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the teasing of his brother, Aureliano Segundo only thought at that time of finding a trade that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would allow him to maintain a house for Petra Cotes, and to die with her, on top of her and under&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">neath her, during a night of feverish license. When Colonel Aureliano Buendia opened up his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">workshop again, seduced at last by the peaceful charms of old age, Aureliano Segundo thought that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it would be good business to devote himself to the manufacture of little gold fishes. He spent many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hours in the hot room watching how the hard sheets of metal, worked by the colonel with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inconceivable patience of disillusionment, were slowly being converted into golden scales. The work </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seemed so laborious to him and the thought of Petra Cotes was so persistent and pressing that after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">three weeks he disappeared from the workshop. It was during that time that it occurred to Petra </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cotes to raffle off rabbits. They reproduced and grew up so fast that there was barely time to sell the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tickets for the raffle. At first Aureliano Segundo did not notice the alarming proportions of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proliferation. But one night, when nobody in town wanted to hear about the rabbit raffle any more, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he heard a noise by the courtyard door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get worried,&rdquo; Petra, Cotes said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rabbits.&rdquo; They could not sleep, tormented by the uproar of the animals. At dawn Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opened the door and saw the courtyard paved with rabbits, blue in the glow of dawn. Petra Cotes, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dying with laughter, could not resist the temptation of teasing him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those are the ones who were born last night,&rdquo; she aid. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you raffle off cows?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days later, in an attempt to clean out her courtyard, Petra Cotes exchanged the rabbits for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cow, who two months later gave birth to triplets. That was how things began. Overnight Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo be. came the owner of land and livestock and he barely had time to enlarge his overflowing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barns and pigpens. It was a delirious prosperity that even made him laugh, and he could not help </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doing crazy things to release his good humor. &ldquo;Cease, cows, life is short,&rdquo; he would shout. Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wondered what entanglements he had got into, whether he might be stealing, whether he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">become a rustler, and every time she saw him uncorking champagne just for the pleasure of pouring </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the foam over his head, she would shout at him and scold him for the waste. It annoyed him so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much that one day when he awoke in a merry mood, Aureliano Segundo appeared with a chest full </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">97 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of money, a can of paste, and a brush, and singing at the top of his lungs the old songs of Francisco </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Man, he papered the house inside and out and from top to bottom, with one-peso banknotes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The old mansion, painted white since the time they had brought the pianola, took on the strange </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">look of a mosque. In the midst of the excitement of the family the scandalization of Ursula, the joy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the people cramming the street to watch that apotheosis of squandering. Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finished by papering the house from the front to the kitchen, including bathrooms and bedrooms, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and threw the leftover bills into the courtyard. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said in a final way, &ldquo;I hope that nobody in this house ever talks to me about money </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was what happened. Ursula had the bills taken down, stuck to great cakes of whitewash, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house was painted white again. &ldquo;Dear Lord,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;make us poor again the way we were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when we founded this town so that you will not collect for this squandering in the other life.&rdquo; Her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prayers were answered in reverse. One of the workmen removing the bills bumped into an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enormous plaster statue of Saint Joseph that someone had left in the house during the last years of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the war and the hollow figure broke to pieces on the floor. It had been stuffed with gold coins. No </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one could remember who had brought that life-sized saint. &ldquo;Three men brought it,&rdquo; Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">explained. &ldquo;They asked us to keep it until the rains were over and I told them to put it there in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">comer where nobody would bump into it, and there they put it, very carefully, and there it&rsquo;s been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ever since because they never came back for it.&rdquo; Later on, Ursula had put candles on it and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prostrated herself before it, not suspecting that instead of a saint she was adoring almost four </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bundled pounds of gold. The tardy evidence of her involuntary paganism made her even more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">upset. She spat on the spectacular pile of coins, put them in three canvas sacks, and buried them in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secret place, hoping that sooner or later the three unknown men would come to reclaim them. Much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">later, during the difficult years of her decrepitude, Ursula would intervene in the conversations of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the many travelers who came by the house at that time and ask them if they had left a plaster Saint </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joseph there during the war to be taken care of until the rains passed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things like that which gave Ursula such consternation, were commonplace in those days. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo was swamped in a miraculous prosperity. The adobe houses of the founders had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">replaced by brick buildings with wooden blinds and cement floors which made the suffocating heat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon more bearable. All that remained at that time of Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa&rsquo;s ancient village were the dusty almond trees, destined to resist the most arduous of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">circumstances, and the river of clear water whose prehistoric stones had been pulverized by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frantic hammers of Jose Arcadio Segundo when he set about opening the channel in order to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">establish a boat line. It was a mad dream, comparable to those of his great-grandfather, for the rocky </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">riverbed and the numerous rapids prevented navigation from Macondo to the sea. But Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo, in an unforeseen burst of temerity, stubbornly kept on with the project. Until then he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shown no sign of imagination. Except for his precarious adventure with Petra Cotes, he had never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">known a woman. Ursula had considered him the quietest example the family had ever produced in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all its history, incapable of standing out even as a handler of fighting cocks, when Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa told him the story of the Spanish galleon aground eight miles from the sea, the carbonized </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frame of which he had seen himself during the war. The story, which for so many years had seemed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fantastic to so many people, was a revelation for Jose Arcadio Segundo. He auctioned off his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">roosters to the highest bidder, recruited men, bought tools, and set about the awesome task of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">breaking stones, digging canals, clearing away rapids, and even harnessing waterfalls. &ldquo;I know all of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">this by heart,&rdquo; Ursula would shout. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if time had turned around and we were back at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beginning.&rdquo; When he thought that the river was navigable, Jose Arcadio Segundo gave his brother a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">detailed account of his plans and the latter gave him the money he needed for the enterprise. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disappeared for a long time. It had been said that his plan to buy a boat was nothing but a trick to </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">98 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">make off with his brother&rsquo;s money when the news spread that a strange craft was approaching the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">town. The inhabitants of Macondo, who no longer remembered the colossal undertakings of Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia, ran to the riverbank and saw with eyes popping in disbelief the arrival of the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and last boat ever to dock in the town. It was nothing but a log raft drawn by thick ropes pulled by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twenty men who walked along the bank. In the prow, with a glow of satisfaction in his eyes, Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo was directing the arduous maneuver. There arrived with him a rich group of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">splendid matrons who were protecting themselves from the burning sun with gaudy parasols, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wore on their shoulders fine silk kerchiefs, with colored creams on their faces and natural flowers in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their hair and golden serpents on their arms and diamonds in their teeth. The log raft was the only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vessel that Jose Arcadio Segundo was able to bring to Macondo, and only once, but he never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recognized the failure of his enterprise, but proclaimed his deed as a victory of will power. He gave a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scmpulous accounting to his brother and very soon plunged back into the routine of cockfights. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only tiling that remained of that unfortunate venture was the breath of renovation that the matrons </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from France brought, as their magnificent arts transformed traditional methods of love and their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sense of social well-being abolished Catarino&rsquo;s antiquated place and turned the street into a bazaar of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese lanterns and nostalgic hand organs. They were the promoters of the bloody carnival that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plunged Macondo into delirium for three days and whose only lasting consequence was having given </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo the opportunity to meet Fernanda del Carpio. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty was proclaimed queen. Ursula, who shuddered at the disquieted beauty of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her great-granddaughter, could not prevent the choice. Until then she had succeeded in keeping her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off the streets unless it was to go to mass with Amaranta, but she made her cover her face with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">black shawl. The most impious men, those who would disguise themselves as priests to say </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sacrilegious masses in Catarino&rsquo;s store, would go to church with an aim to see, if only for an instant, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the face of Remedios the Beauty, whose legendary good looks were spoken of with alarming </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">excitement throughout the swamp. It was a long time before they were able to do so, and it would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have been better for them if they never had, because most of them never recovered their peaceful </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">habits of sleep. The man who made it possible, a foreigner, lost his serenity forever, became </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">involved in the sloughs of abjection and misery, and years later was cut to pieces by a train after he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had fallen asleep on the tracks. From the moment he was seen in the church, wearing a green velvet </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suit and an embroidered vest, no one doubted that he came from far away, perhaps from some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distant city outside of the country, attracted by the magical fascination of Remedios the Beauty. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was so handsome, so elegant and dignified, with such presence, that Pietro Crespi would have been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a mere fop beside him and many women whispered with spiteful smiles that he was the one who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">really should have worn the shawl. He did not speak to anyone in Macondo. He appeared at dawn </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on Sunday like a prince in a fairy tale, riding a horse with silver stirmps and a velvet blanket, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">left town after mass. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power of his presence was such that from the first time he was seen in the church everybody </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took it for granted that a silent and tense duel had been established between him and Remedios the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beauty, a secret pact, an irrevocable challenge that would end not only in love but also in death. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the sixth Sunday the gentleman appeared with a yellow rose in his hand. He heard mass standing, as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he always did, and at the end he stepped in front of Remedios the Beauty and offered her the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitary rose. She took it with a natural gesture, as if she had been prepared for that homage, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then she uncovered her face and gave her thanks with a smile. That was all she did. Not only for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gentleman, but for all the men who had the unfortunate privilege of seeing her, that was an eternal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">instant. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From then on the gentleman had a band of musicians play beside the window of Remedios the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beauty, sometimes until dawn. Aureliano Segundo was the only one who felt a cordial compassion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for him and he tried to break his perseverance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your time any more,&rdquo; he told him one </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">99 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night. &ldquo;The women in this house are worse than mules.&rdquo; He offered him his friendship, invited him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to bathe in champagne, tried to make him understand that the females of his family had insides </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made of flint, but he could not weaken his obstinacy. Exasperated by the interminable nights of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">music. Colonel Aureliano Buendia threatened to cure his affliction with a few pistol shots. Nothing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made him desist except his own lamentable state of demoralization. From a well-dressed and neat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">individual he became filthy and ragged. It was rumored that he had abandoned power and fortune in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his distant nation, although his origins were actually never known. He became argumentative, a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barroom brawler, and he would wake up rolling in his own filth in Catarino&rsquo;s store. The saddest part </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his drama was that Remedios the Beauty did not notice him not even when he appeared in church </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dressed like a prince. She accepted the yellow rose without the least bit of malice, amused, rather, by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the extravagance of the act, and she lifted her shawl to see his face better, not to show hers. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, Remedios the Beauty was not a creature of this world. Until she was well along in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">puberty Santa Sofia de la. Piedad had to bathe and dress her, and even when she could take care of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">herself it was necessary to keep an eye on her so that she would not paint little animals on the walls </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a stick daubed in her own excrement. She reached twenty without knowing how to read or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">write, unable to use the silver at the table, wandering naked through the house because her nature </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rejected all manner of convention. When the young commander of the guard declared his love for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her, she rejected him simply because his frivolity startled her. &ldquo;See how simple he is,&rdquo; she told </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta. &ldquo;He says that he&rsquo;s dying because of me, as if I were a bad case of colic.&rdquo; When, indeed, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they found him dead beside her window, Remedios the Beauty confirmed her first impression. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;He was a complete Simpleton.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed as if some penetrating lucidity permitted her to see the reality of things beyond any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">formalism. That at least was the point of view of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, for whom Remedios </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Beauty was in no way mentally retarded, as was generally believed, but quite the opposite. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">if she&rsquo;s come back from twenty years of war,&rdquo; he would say. Ursula, for her part, thanked God for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">having awarded the family with a creature of exceptional purity, but at the same time she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disturbed by her beauty, for it seemed a contradictory virtue to her, a diabolical trap at the center of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her innocence. It was for that reason that she decided to keep her away from the world, to protect </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her from all earthly temptation, not knowing that Remedios the Beauty, even from the time when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she was in her mother&rsquo;s womb, was safe from any contagion. It never entered her head that they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would elect her beauty queen of the carnival pandemonium. But Aureliano, Segundo, excited at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">caprice of disguising himself as a tiger, brought Father Antonio Isabel to the house in order to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convince Ursula that the carnival was not a pagan feast, as she said, but a Catholic tradition. Finally </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced, even though reluctantly, she consented to the coronation. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The news that Remedios Buendia was going to be the sovereign mler of the festival went beyond </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the limits of the swamp in a few hours, reached distant places where the prestige of her beauty was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not known, and it aroused the anxiety of those who still thought of her last name as a symbol of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">subversion. The anxiety was baseless. If anyone had become harmless at that time it was the aging </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and disillusioned Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who was slowly losing all contact with the reality of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the nation. Enclosed in his workshop, his only relationship with the rest of the world was his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">business in little gold fishes. One of the soldiers who had guarded his house during the first days of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">peace would go sell them in the villages of the swamp and return loaded down with coins and news. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That the Conservative government, he would say, with the backing of the Liberals, was reforming </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the calendar so that every president could remain in power for a hundred years. That the concordat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the Holy See had finally been signed and a cardinal had come from Rome with a crown of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">diamonds and a throne of solid gold, and that the Liberal ministers had had their pictures taken on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their knees in the act of kissing his ring. That the leading lady of a Spanish company passing through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the capital had been kidnapped by a band of masked highwaymen and on the following Sunday she </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">100 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had danced in the nude at the summer house of the president of the republic. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about politics,&rdquo; the colonel would tell him. &ldquo;Our business is selling little fishes.&rdquo; The rumor that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not want to hear anything about the situation in the country because he was growing rich in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">workshop made Ursula laugh when it reached her ears. With her terrible practical sense she could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not understand the colonel&rsquo;s business as he exchanged little fishes for gold coins and then converted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the coins into little fishes, and so on, with the result that he had to work all the harder with the more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicious circle. Actually, what interested him was not the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">business but the work. He needed so much concentration to link scales, fit minute rubies into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eyes, laminate gills, and put on fins that there was not the smallest empty moment left for him to fill </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with his disillusionment of the war. So absorbing was the attention required by the delicacy of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">artistry that in a short time he had aged more than during all the years of the war, and his position </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had twisted his spine and the close work had used up his eyesight, but the implacable concentration </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">awarded him with a peace of the spirit. The last time he was seen to take an interest in some matter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">related to the war was when a group of veterans from both parties sought his support for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">approval of lifetime pensions, which had always been promised and were always about to be put into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">effect. &ldquo;Forget about it,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;You can see how I refuse my pension in order to get rid of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the torture of waiting for it until the day I died.&rdquo; At first Colonel Gerineldo Marquez would visit him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at dusk and they would both sit in the street door and talk about the past. But Amaranta could not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bear the memories that that man, whose baldness had plunged him into the abyss of premature old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">age, aroused in her, and she would torment him with snide remarks until he did not come back </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">except on special occasions and he finally disappeared, extinguished by paralysis. Taciturn, silent, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house. Colonel Aureliano Buendia could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would get up at five in the morning after a light sleep, have his eternal mug of bitter coffee in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kitchen, shut himself up all day in the workshop, and at four in the afternoon he would go along the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">porch dragging a stool, not even noticing the fire of the rose bushes or the brightness of the hour or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the persistence of Amaranta, whose melancholy made the noise of a boiling pot, which was perfectly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perceptible at dusk, and he would sit in the street door as long as the mosquitoes would allow him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to. Someone dared to disturb his solitude once. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How are you, Colonel?&rdquo; he asked in passing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Waiting for my funeral procession to pass.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that the anxiety caused by the public reappearance of his family name, having to do with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">coronation of Remedios the Beauty, was baseless. Many people did not think that way, however. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Innocent of the tragedy that threatened it, the town poured into the main square in a noisy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">explosion of merriment. The carnival had reached its highest level of madness and Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo had satisfied at last his dream of dressing up like a tiger and was walking along the wild </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">throng, hoarse from so much roaring, when on the swamp road a parade of several people appeared </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carrying in a gilded litter the most fascinating woman that imagination could conceive. For a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment the inhabitants of Macondo took off their masks in order to get a better look at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dazzling creature with a crown of emeralds and an ermine cape, who seemed invested with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">legitimate authority, and was not merely a sovereign of bangles and crepe paper. There were many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people who had sufficient insight to suspect that it was a question of provocation. But Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo immediately conquered his perplexity and declared the new arrivals to be guests of honor, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and with the wisdom of Solomon he seated Remedios the Beauty and the intmding queen on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same dais. Until midnight the strangers, disguised as bedouins, took part in the delirium and even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enriched it with sumptuous fireworks and acrobatic skills that made one think of the art of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gypsies. Suddenly, during the paroxysm of the celebration, someone broke the delicate balance. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long live the Liberal party!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendia!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">101 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rifle shots drowned out the splendor of the fireworks and the cries of terror drowned out the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">music and joy turned into panic. Many years later there were those who still insisted that the royal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">guard of the intruding queen was a squad of regular army soldiers who were concealing government- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">issue rifles under their rich Moorish robes. The government denied the charge in a special </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proclamation and promised a complete investigation of the bloody episode. But the tmth never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came to light, and the version always prevailed that the royal guard, without provocation of any kind, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took up combat positions upon a signal from their commander and opened fire without pity on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crowd. When calm was restored, not one of the false bedouins remained in town and there were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many dead and wounded lying on the square: nine clowns, four Columbines, seventeen playing-card </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kings, one devil, three minstrels, two peers of France, and three Japanese empresses. In the confu&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sion of the panic Jose Arcadio Segundo managed to rescue Remedios the Beauty and Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo carried the intruding queen to the house in his arms, her dress torn and the ermine cape </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stained with blood. Her name was Fernanda del Carpio. She had been chosen as the most beautiful </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the five thousand most beautiful women in the land and they had brought her to Macondo with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the promise of naming her Queen of Madagascar. Ursula took care of her as if she were her own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">daughter. The town, instead of doubting her innocence, pitied her candor. Six months after the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">massacre, when the wounded had recovered and the last flowers on the mass grave had withered, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo went to fetch her from the distant city where she lived with her father and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">married her in Macondo with a noisy celebration that lasted twenty days. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">102 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 11 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE MARRIAGE was on the point of breaking up after two months because Aureliano Segundo, in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an attempt to placate Petra Cotes, had a picture taken of her dressed as the Queen of Madagascar. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Fernanda found out about it she repacked her bridal trunks and left Macondo without saying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">good-bye. Aureliano Segundo caught up with her on the swamp road. After much pleading and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promises of reform he succeeded in getting her to come home and he abandoned his concubine. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petra Cotes, aware of her strength, showed no signs of worry. She had made a man of him. While </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was still a child she had drawn him out of Melquiades&rsquo; room, his head full of fantastic ideas and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lacking any contact with reality, and she had given him a place in the world. Nature had made him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reserved and withdrawn, with tendencies toward solitary meditation, and she had molded an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opposite character in him, one that was vital, expansive, open, and she had injected him with a joy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for living and a pleasure in spending and celebrating until she had converted him inside and out, into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the man she had dreamed of for herself ever since adolescence. Then he married, as all sons marry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sooner or later. He did not dare tell her the news. He assumed an attitude that was quite childish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">under the circumstances, feigning anger and imaginary resentment so that Petra Cotes would be the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one who would bring about the break. One day, when Aureliano Segundo reproached her unjustly, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she eluded the trap and put things in their proper place. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What it all means,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is that you want to marry the queen.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo, ashamed, pretended an attack of rage, said that he was misunderstood and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">abused, and did not visit her again. Petra Cotes, without losing her poise of a wild beast in repose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for a single instant, heard the music and the fireworks from the wedding, the wild bustle of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">celebration as if all of it were nothing but some new piece of mischief on the part of Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo. Those who pitied her fate were calmed with a smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she told them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Queens run errands for me.&rdquo; To a neighbor woman who brought her a set of candles so that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could light up the picture of her lost lover with them, she said with an enigmatic security: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The only candle that will make him come is always lighted.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as she had foreseen, Aureliano Segundo went back to her house as soon as the honeymoon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was over. He brought his usual old friends, a traveling photographer, and the gown and ermine cape </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soiled with blood that Fernanda had worn during the carnival. In the heat of the merriment that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">broke out that evening, he had Petra Cotes dress up as queen, crowned her absolute and lifetime </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ruler of Madagascar, and handed out copies of the picture to his friends, she not only went along </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the game, but she felt sorry for him inside, thinking that he must have been very frightened to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have conceived of that extravagant means of reconciliation. At seven in the evening, still dressed as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the queen, she received him in bed. He had been married scarcely two months, but she realized at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">once that tilings were not going well in the nuptial bed, and she had the delicious pleasure of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vengeance fulfilled. Two days later, however, when he did not dare return but sent an intermediary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to arrange the terms of the separation, she understood that she was going to need more patience </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than she had foreseen because he seemed ready to sacrifice himself for the sake of appearances. Nor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did she get upset that time. Once again she made things easy with a submission that confirmed the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">generalized belief that she was a poor devil, and the only souvenir she kept of Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a pair of patent leather boots, which, according to what he himself had said, were the ones he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted to wear in his coffin. She kept them wrapped in cloth in the bottom of a trunk and made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ready to feed on memories, waiting without despair. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He has to come sooner or later,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;even if it&rsquo;s just to put on those boots.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">103 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did not have to wait as long as she had imagined. Actually, Aureliano Segundo understood </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the night of his wedding that he would return to the house of Petra Cotes much sooner than </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he would have to put on the patent leather boots: Fernanda was a woman who was lost in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">world. She had been born and raised in a city six hundred miles away, a gloomy city where on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ghostly nights the coaches of the viceroys still rattled through the cobbled streets. Thirty-two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">belfries tolled a dirge at six in the afternoon. In the manor house, which was paved with tomblike </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slabs, the sun was never seen. The air had died in the cypresses in the courtyard, in the pale </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trappings of the bedrooms, in the dripping archways of the garden of perennials. Until puberty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda had no news of the world except for the melancholy piano lessons taken in some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">neighboring house by someone who for years and years had the drive not to take a siesta. In the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room of her sick mother, green and yellow under the powdery light from the windowpanes, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would listen to the methodical, stubborn, heartless scales and think that that music was in the world </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">while she was being consumed as she wove funeral wreaths. Her mother, perspiring with five- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">o&rsquo;clock fever, spoke to her of the splendor of the past. When she was a little girl, on one moonlit </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night Fernanda saw a beautiful woman dressed in white crossing the garden toward the chapel. What </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bothered her most about that fleeting vision was that she felt it was exactly like her, as if she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seen herself twenty years in advance. &ldquo;It was your great-grandmother the queen,&rdquo; her mother told </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her during a tmce in her coughing. &ldquo;She died of some bad vapors while she was cutting a string of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bulbs.&rdquo; Many years later, when she began to feel she was the equal of her great-grandmother, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda doubted her childhood vision, but her mother scolded her disbelief. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are immensely rich and powerful,&rdquo; she told her. &ldquo;One day you will be a queen.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She believed it, even though they were sitting at the long table with a linen tablecloth and silver </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">service to have a cup of watered chocolate and a sweet bun. Until the day of her wedding she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dreamed about a legendary kingdom, in spite of the fact that her father, Don Fernando, had to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mortgage the house in order to buy her trousseau. It was not innocence or delusions of grandeur. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how they had brought her up. Since she had had the use of reason she remembered having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">done her duty in a gold pot with the family crest on it. She left the house for the first time at the age </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of twelve in a coach and horses that had to travel only two blocks to take her to the convent. Her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">classmates were surprised that she sat apart from them in a chair with a very high back and that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would not even mingle with them during recess. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; the nuns would explain. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">going to be a queen.&rdquo; Her schoolmates believed this because she was already the most beautiful, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distinguished, and discreet girl they had ever seen. At the end of eight years, after having learned to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">write Latin poetry, play the clavichord, talk about falconry with gentlemen and apologetics, with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">archbishops, discuss affairs of state with foreign mlers and affairs of God with the Pope, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returned to her parents&rsquo; home to weave funeral wreaths. She found it despoiled. All that was left was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the furniture that was absolutely necessary, the silver candelabra and table service, for the everyday </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">utensils had been sold one by one to underwrite the costs of her education. Her mother had suc&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cumbed to five-o&rsquo;clock fever. Her father, Don Fernando, dressed in black with a stiff collar and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gold watch chain, would give her a silver coin on Mondays for the household expenses, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">funeral wreaths finished the week before would be taken away. He spent most of his time shut up in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his study and the few times that he went out he would return to recite the rosary with her. She had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intimate friendships with no one. She had never heard mention of the wars that were bleeding the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">country. She continued her piano lessons at three in the afternoon. She had even began to lose the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">illusion of being a queen when two peremptory raps of the knocker sounded at the door and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opened it to a well-groomed military officer with ceremonious manners who had a scar on his cheek </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and a gold medal on his chest. He closeted himself with her father in the study. Two hours later her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">father came to get her in the sewing room. &ldquo;Get your things together,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;You have to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take a long trip.&rdquo; That was how they took her to Macondo. In one single day, with a bmtal slap, life </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">104 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">threw on top of her the whole weight of a reality that her parents had kept hidden from her for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many years. When she returned home she shut herself up in her room to weep, indifferent to Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernando&rsquo;s pleas and explanations as he tried to erase the scars of that strange joke. She had sworn </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to herself never to leave her bedroom until she died when Aureliano Segundo came to get her. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was an act of impossible fate, because in the confusion of her indignation, in the fury of her shame, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had lied to him so that he would never know her real identity. The only real clues that Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo had when he left to look for her were her unmistakable highland accent and her trade as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weaver of funeral wreaths. He searched for her without cease. With the fierce temerity with which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia had crossed the mountains to found Macondo, with the blind pride with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which Colonel Aureliano Buendia had undertaken his fmitless wars, with the mad tenacity with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which Ursula watched over the survival of the line, Aureliano Segundo looked for Fernanda, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a single moment of respite. When he asked where they sold funeral wreaths they took him from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house to house so that he could choose the best ones. When he asked for the most beautiful woman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who had ever been seen on this earth, all the women brought him their daughters. He became lost in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">misty byways, in times reserved for oblivion, in labyrinths of disappointment. He crossed a yellow </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plain where the echo repeated one&rsquo;s thoughts and where anxiety brought on premonitory mirages. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After sterile weeks he came to an unknown city where all the bells were tolling a dirge. Although he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had never seen them and no one had ever described them to him he immediately recognized the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walls eaten away by bone salt, the broken-down wooden balconies gutted by fungus, and nailed to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the outside door, almost erased by rain, the saddest cardboard sign in the world: Funeral Wreaths for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sale. From that moment until the icy morning when Fernanda left her house under the care of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mother Superior there was barely enough time for the nuns to sew her trousseau and in six trunks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put the candelabra, the silver service, and the gold chamberpot along with the countless and useless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remains of a family catastrophe that had been two centuries late in its fulfillment. Don Fernando </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">declined the invitation to go along. He promised to go later when he had cleared up his affairs, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the moment when he gave his daughter his blessing he shut himself up in his study again to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">write out the announcements with mournful sketches and the family coat of arms, which would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the first human contact that Fernanda and her father would have had in all their lives. That was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">real date of her birth for her. For Aureliano Segundo it was almost simultaneously the beginning and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the end of happiness. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda carried a delicate calendar with small golden keys on which her spiritual adviser had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marked in purple ink the dates of venereal abstinence. Not counting Holy week, Sundays, holy days </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of obligation, first Fridays, retreats, sacrifices, and cyclical impediments, her effective year was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reduced to forty-two days that were spread out through a web of purple crosses. Aureliano Segundo, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced that time would break up that hostile network, prolonged the wedding celebration be&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">yond the expected time. Tired of throwing out so many empty brandy and champagne bottles so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that they would not clutter up the house and at the same time intrigued by the fact that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">newlyweds slept at different times and in separate rooms while the fireworks and music and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slaughtering of cattle went on, Ursula remembered her own experience and wondered whether Fer&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nanda might have a chastity belt too which would sooner or later provoke jokes in the town and give </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rise to a tragedy. But Fernanda confessed to her that she was just letting two weeks go by before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">allowing the first contact with her husband. Indeed, when the period was over, she opened her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom with a resignation worthy of an expiatory victim and Aureliano Segundo saw the most </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beautiful woman on earth, with her glorious eyes of a frightened animal and her long, copper- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colored hair spread out across the pillow. He was so fascinated with that vision that it took him a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment to realize that Fernanda was wearing a white nightgown that reached down to her ankles, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with long sleeves and with a large, round buttonhole, delicately trimmed, at the level of her lower </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stomach. Aureliano Segundo could not suppress an explosion of laughter. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">105 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most obscene thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life,&rdquo; he shouted with a laugh that rang </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the house. &ldquo;I married a Sister of Charity.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A month later, unsuccessful in getting his wife to take off her nightgown, he had the picture </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taken of Petra Cotes dressed as a queen. Later on, when he succeeded in getting Fernanda to come </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back home, she gave in to his urges in the fever of reconciliation, but she could not give him the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">repose he had dreamed about when he went to fetch her in the city with the thirty-two belfries. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo found only a deep feeling of desolation in her. One night, a short time before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their first child was born, Fernanda realized that her husband had returned in secret to the bed of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petra Cotes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happened,&rdquo; he admitted. And he explained in a tone of prostrated resignation: &ldquo;I </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had to do it so that the animals would keep on breeding.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He needed a little time to convince her about such a strange expedient, but when he finally did so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by means of proofs that seemed irrefutable, the only promise that Fernanda demanded from him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was that he should not be surprised by death in his concubine&rsquo;s bed. In that way the three of them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">continued living without bothering each other. Aureliano Segundo, punctual and loving with both of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them. Petra Cotes, strutting because of the reconciliation, and Fernanda, pretending that she did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">know the truth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pact did not succeed, however, in incorporating Fernanda into the family. Ursula insisted in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vain that she take off the woolen ruff which she would have on when she got up from making love </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and which made the neighbors whisper. She could not convince her to use the bathroom or the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night lavatory and sell the gold chamberpot to Colonel Aureliano Buendia so that he could convert </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it into little fishes. Amaranta felt so uncomfortable with her defective diction and her habit of using </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">euphemisms to designate everything that she would always speak gibberish in front of her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thifisif.&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;ifisif onefos ofosif thofosif whosufu cantantant statantand thefesef </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">smufumellu ofosif therisir owfisown shifisifit.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One day, irritated by the mockery, Fernanda wanted to know what Amaranta was saying, and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not use euphemisms in answering her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was saying,&rdquo; she told her, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re one of those people who mix up their ass and their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ashes.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that time on they did not speak to each other again. When circumstances demanded it they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would send notes. In spite of the visible hostility of the family, Fernanda did not give up her drive to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impose the customs of her ancestors. She put an end to the custom of eating in the kitchen and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whenever anyone was hungry, and she imposed the obligation of doing it at regular hours at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">large table in the dining room, covered with a linen cloth and with silver candlesticks and table </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">service. The solemnity of an act which Ursula had considered the most simple one of daily life </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">created a tense atmosphere against which the silent Jose Arcadio Segundo rebelled before anyone </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">else. But the custom was imposed, the same as that of reciting the rosary before dinner, and it drew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the attention of the neighbors, who soon spread the rumor that the Buendias did not sit down to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">table like other mortals but had changed the act of eating into a kind of high mass. Even Ursula&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">superstitions, with origins that came more from an inspiration of the moment than from tradition, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came into conflict with those of Fernanda, who had inherited them from her parents and kept them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">defined and catalogued for every occasion. As long as Ursula had full use of her faculties some of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the old customs survived and the life of the family kept some quality of her impulsiveness, but when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she lost her sight and the weight of her years relegated her to a corner, the circle of rigidity begun by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda from the moment she arrived finally closed completely and no one but she determined the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">destiny of the family. The business in pastries and small candy animals that Santa Sofia de la Piedad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had kept up because of Ursula&rsquo;s wishes was considered an unworthy activity by Fernanda and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lost no time in putting a stop to it. The doors of the house, wide open from dawn until bedtime. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">106 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were closed during siesta time under the pretext that the sun heated up the bedrooms and in the end </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they were closed for good. The aloe branch and loaf of bread that had been hanging over the door </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since the days of the founding were replaced by a niche with the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, Buendia became aware somehow of those changes and foresaw their consequences. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re becoming people of quality,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;At this rate we&rsquo;ll end up fighting against the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conservative regime again, but this time to install a king in its place.&rdquo; Fernanda very tactfully tried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not to cross Iris path. Within herself she was bothered by his independent spirit his resistance to all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kinds of social rigidity. She was exasperated by his mugs of coffee at five in the morning, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disorder of his workshop, his frayed blanket, and his custom of sitting in the street door at dusk. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had to tolerate that one loose piece in the family machinery because she was sure that the old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colonel was an animal who had been tamed by the years and by disappointment and who, in a burst </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of senile rebellion, was quite capable of uprooting the foundations of the house. When her husband </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decided to give their first son the name of Iris great-grandfather, she did not dare oppose him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because she had been there only a year. But when the first daughter was bom she expressed her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unreserved determination to name her Renata after her mother. Ursula had decided to call her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios. After a tense argument, in which Aureliano Segundo acted as the laughing go-between, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they baptized her with the name Renata Remedios, but Fernanda went on calling her just Renata </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">while her husband&rsquo;s family and everyone in town called her Meme, a diminutive of Remedios. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first Fernanda did not talk about her family, but in time she began to idealize her father. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spoke of him at the table as an exceptional being who had renounced all forms of vanity and was on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his way to becoming a saint. Aureliano Segundo, startled at that unbridled glorification of his father- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in-law, could not resist the temptation to make small jokes behind his wife&rsquo;s back. The rest of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">family followed his example. Even Ursula, who was extremely careful to preserve family harmony </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and who suffered in secret from the domestic friction, once allowed herself the liberty of saying that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her little great-great-grandson had his pontifical future assured because he was &ldquo;the grandson of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saint and the son of a queen and a rustler.&rdquo; In spite of that conspiracy of smiles, the children became </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accustomed to think of their grandfather as a legendary being who wrote them pious verses in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letters and every Christmas sent them a box of gifts that barely fitted through the outside door. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually they were the last remains of his lordly inheritance. They used them to build an altar of life- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">size saints in the children&rsquo;s bedroom, saints with glass eyes that gave them a disquietingly lifelike </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">look, whose artistically embroidered clothing was better than that worn by any inhabitant of Macon- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">do. Little by little the funereal splendor of the ancient and icy mansion was being transformed into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the splendor of the House of Buendia. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve already sent us the whole family cemetery,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo commented one day. &ldquo;All we need now are the weeping willows and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tombstones.&rdquo; Although nothing ever arrived in the boxes that the children could play with, they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would spend all year waiting for December because, after all, the antique and always unpredictable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gifts were something, new in the house. On the tenth Christmas, when little Jose Arcadio was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">getting ready to go to the seminary, the enormous box from their grandfather arrived earlier than </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">usual, nailed tight and protected with pitch, and addressed in the usual Gothic letters to the Very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Distinguished Lady Dona Fernanda del Carpio de Buendia. While she read the letter in her room the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children hastened to open the box. Aided as was customary by Aureliano Segundo, they broke the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seals, opened the cover, took out the protective sawdust, and found inside a long lead chest closed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by copper bolts. Aureliano Segundo took out the eight bolts as the children watched impatiently, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he barely had time to give a cry and push the children aside when be raised the lead cover and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saw Don Fernando, dressed in black and with a crucifix on his chest, Iris skin broken out in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pestilential sores and cooking slowly in a frothy stew with bubbles like live pearls. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A short time after the birth of their daughter, the unexpected jubilee for Colonel Aureliano, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia, ordered by the government to celebrate another anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia, </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">107 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was announced. It was a decision so out of line with official policy that the colonel spoke out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">violently against it and rejected the homage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever heard of the word &lsquo;jubilee,&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But whatever it means, it has to be a trick.&rdquo; The small goldsmith shop was filled with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">emissaries. Much older and more solemn, the lawyers in dark suits who in other days had flapped </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about the colonel like crows had returned. When he saw them appear the same as the other time, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when they came to put a stop to the war, he could not bear the cynicism of their praise. He ordered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them to leave him in peace, insisting that he was not a hero of the nation as they said but an artisan </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without memories whose only dream was to die of fatigue in the oblivion and misery of his little </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gold fishes. What made him most indignant was the word that the president of the republic himself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">planned to be present at the ceremonies in Macondo in order to decorate him with the Order of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Merit. Colonel Aureliano, Buendfa had him told, word for word, that he was eagerly awaiting that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tardy but deserved occasion in order to take a shot at him, not as payment for the arbitrary acts and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anachronisms of his regime, but for his lack of respect for an old man who had not done anyone any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">harm. Such was the vehemence with which he made the threat that the president of the republic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">canceled his trip at the last moment and sent the decoration with a personal representative. Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerineldo Marquez, besieged by pressures of all kinds, left his bed of a paralytic in order to persuade </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his former companion in arms. When the latter saw the rocking chair carried by four men appear </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and saw the friend who had shared his victories and defeats since youth sitting in it among some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">large pillows, he did not have a single doubt but that he was making that effort in order to express </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his solidarity. But when he discovered the real motive for his visit he had them take him out of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">workshop. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m convinced too late,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;that I would have done you a great favor if I&rsquo;d let </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them shoot you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the jubilee was celebrated without the attendance of any members of the family. Chance had it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it also coincided with carnival week, but no one could get the stubborn idea out of Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia&rsquo;s head that the coincidence had been foreseen by the government in order to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heighten the cmelty of the mockery. From his lonely workshop he could hear the martial music, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">artillery salutes, the tolling of the Te Deum, and a few phrases of the speeches delivered in front of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house as they named the street after him. His eyes grew moist with indignation, with angry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impotence, and for the first time since his defeat it pained him not to have the strength of youth so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he could begin a bloody war that would wipe out the last vestiges of the Conservative regime. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The echoes of the homage had not died down when Ursula knocked at the workshop door. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Open up,&rdquo; Ursula insisted in a normal voice. &ldquo;This has nothing to do with the celebration.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Colonel Aureliano Buendia took down the bar and saw at the door seventeen men of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">most varied appearance, of all types and colors, but all with a solitary air that would have been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough to identify them anywhere on earth. They were his sons. Without any previous agreement, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without knowing each other, they had arrived from the most distant corners of the coast, captivated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the talk of the jubilee. They all bore with pride the name Aureliano and the last name of their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mothers. The three days that they stayed in the house, to the satisfaction of Ursula and the scandal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Fernanda, were like a state war. Amaranta searched among old papers for the ledger where Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had written down the names and birth and baptism dates of all of them, and beside the space for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">each one she added his present address. That list could well have served as a recapitulation of twenty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">years of war. From it the nocturnal itinerary of the colonel from the dawn he left Macondo at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">head of twenty-one men on his way to a fanciful rebellion until he returned for the last time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrapped in a blanket stiff with blood could have been reconstructed. Aureliano Segundo did not let </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the chance go by to regale his cousins with a thunderous champagne and accordion party that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interpreted as a tardy adjustment of accounts with the carnival, which went awry because of the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">108 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">jubilee. They smashed half of the dishes, they destroyed the rose bushes as they chased a bull they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were trying to hog-tie, they killed the hens by shooting them, they made Amaranta dance the sad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waltzes of Pietro Crespi, they got Remedios the Beauty to put on a pair of men&rsquo;s pants and climb a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">greased pole, and in the dining room they turned loose a pig daubed with lard, which prostrated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda, but no one regretted the destruction because the house shook with a healthy earthquake. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia who at first received them with mistrust and even doubted the parentage </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of some, was amused by their wildness, and before they left he gave each one a little gold fish. Even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the withdrawn Jose Arcadio Segundo offered them an afternoon of cockfights, which was at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">point of ending in tragedy because several of the Aurelianos were so expert in matters of the cockpit </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that they spotted Father Antonio Isabel&rsquo;s tricks at once. Aureliano Segundo, who saw the limitless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prospect of wild times offered by those mad relatives, decided that they should all stay and work for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him. The only one who accepted was Aureliano Triste, a big mulatto with the drive and explorer&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spirit of his grandfather. Fie had already tested his fortune in half the world and it did not matter to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him where he stayed. The others, even though they were unmarried, considered their destinies </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">established. They were all skillful craftsmen, the men of their houses, peace-loving people. The Ash </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday before they went back to scatter out along the coast, Amaranta got them to put on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sunday clothes and accompany her to church. More amused than devout, they let themselves be led </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the altar rail where Father Antonio Isabel made the sign of the cross in ashes on them. Back at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house, when the youngest tried to clean his forehead, he discovered that the mark was indelible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and so were those of his brothers. They tried soap and water, earth and a scrubbing brush, and lastly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a pumice stone and lye, but they could not remove the crosses. On the other hand, Amaranta and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the others who had gone to mass took it off without any trouble. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that way,&rdquo; Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stated as she said goodbye to them. &ldquo;From now on everyone will know who you are.&rdquo; They went off </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in a troop, preceded by a band of musicians and shooting off fireworks, and they left behind in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">town an impression that the Buendia line had enough seed for many centuries. Aureliano Triste, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the cross of ashes on his forehead, set up on the edge of town the ice factory that Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia had dreamed of in his inventive delirium. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some months after his arrival, when he was already well-known and well-liked, Aureliano Triste </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went about looking for a house so that he could send for his mother and an unmarried sister (who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was not the colonel&rsquo;s daughter), and he became interested in the run-down big house that looked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">abandoned on a corner of the square. Fie asked who owned it. Someone told him that it did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">belong to anyone, that in former times a solitary widow who fed on earth and whitewash from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walls had lived there, and that in her last years she was seen only twice on the street with a hat of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tiny artificial flowers and shoes the color of old silver when she crossed the square to the post office </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to mail a letter to the Bishop. They told him that her only companion was a pitiless servant woman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who killed dogs and cats and any animal that got into the house and threw their corpses into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">middle of the street in order to annoy people with the rotten stench. So much time had passed since </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the sun had mummified the empty skin of the last animal that everybody took it for granted that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lady of the house and the maid had died long before the wars were over, and that if the house was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">still standing it was because in recent years there had not been a rough winter or destructive wind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hinges had cmmbled with mst, the doors were held up only by clouds of cobwebs, the windows </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were soldered shut by dampness, and the floor was broken by grass and wildflowers and in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cracks lizards and all manner of vermin had their nests, all of which seemed to confirm the notion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that there had not been a human being there for at least half a century. The impulsive Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Triste did not need such proof to proceed. Fie pushed on the main door with his shoulder and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worm-eaten wooden frame fell down noiselessly amid a dull cataclysm of dust and termite nests. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Triste stood on the threshold waiting for the dust to clear and then he saw in the center of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the room the squalid woman, still dressed in clothing of the past century, with a few yellow threads </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">109 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on her bald head, and with two large eyes, still beautiful, in which the last stars of hope had gone </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out, and the skin of her face was wrinkled by the aridity of solitude. Shaken by that vision from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">another world, Aureliano Triste barely noticed that the woman was aiming an antiquated pistol at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he murmured. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remained motionless in the center of the room filled with knickknacks, examining inch by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inch the giant with square shoulders and with a tattoo of ashes on his forehead, and through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">haze of dust she saw him in the haze of other times with a double-barreled shotgun on his shoulder </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and a string of rabbits in his hand. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For the love of God,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, it&rsquo;s not right for them to come to me with that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memory now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to rent the house,&rdquo; Aureliano Triste said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman then raised the pistol, aiming with a firm wrist at the cross of ashes, and she held the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trigger with a determination against which there was no appeal. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; she ordered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night at dinner Aureliano Triste told the family about the episode and Ursula wept with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consternation. &ldquo;Holy God!&rdquo; she exclaimed, clutching her head with her hands. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s still alive!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time, wars, the countless everyday disasters had made her forget about Rebeca. The only one who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not lost for a single minute the awareness that she was alive and rotting in her wormhole was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the implacable and aging Amaranta. She thought of her at dawn, when the ice of her heart awakened </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her in her solitary bed, and she thought of her when she soaped her withered breasts and her lean </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stomach, and when she put on the white stiff-starched petticoats and corsets of old age, and when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she changed the black bandage of terrible expiation on her hand. Always, at every moment, asleep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and awake, during the most sublime and most abject moments, Amaranta thought about Rebeca, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because solitude had made a selection in her memory and had burned the dimming piles of nostalgic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waste that life had accumulated in her heart, and had purified, magnified and eternalized the others, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the most bitter ones. Remedios the Beauty knew about Rebeca&rsquo;s existence from her. Every time they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passed the run-down house she would tell her about an unpleasant incident, a tale of hate, trying in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that way to make her extended rancor be shared by her niece and consequently prolonged beyond </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death, but her plan did not work because Remedios was immune to any kind of passionate feelings </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and much less to those of others. Ursula, on the other hand, who had suffered through a process </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opposite to Amaranta&rsquo;s, recalled Rebeca with a memory free of impurities, for the image of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pitiful child brought to the house with the bag containing her parents&rsquo; bones prevailed over the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">offense that had made her unworthy to be connected to the family tree any longer. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo decided that they would have to bring her to the house and take care of her, but his good </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intentions were frustrated by the firm intransigence of Rebeca, who had needed many years of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suffering and misery in order to attain the privileges of solitude and who was not disposed to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">renounce them in exchange for an old age disturbed by the false attractions of charity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In February, when the sixteen sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa returned, still marked with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cross of ashes, Aureliano Triste spoke to them about Rebeca in the tumult of the celebration and in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">half a day they restored the appearance of the house, changing doors and windows, painting the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">front with gay colors, bracing walls and pouring fresh cement on the floor, but they could not get </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">any authorization to continue the work inside. Rebeca did not even come to the door. She let them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finish the mad restoration, then calculated what it had cost and sent Argenida, her old servant who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was still with her, to them with a handful of coins that had been withdrawn from circulation after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the last war and that Rebeca thought were still worth something it was then that they saw to what a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fantastic point her separation from the world had arrived and they understood that it would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impossible to rescue her from her stubborn enclosure while she still had a breath of life in her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">110 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the second visit by the sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendia to Macondo, another of them, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Centeno, stayed on to work with Aureliano Triste. He was one of the first who had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought to the house for baptism and Ursula and Amaranta remembered him very well because in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">few hours he had destroyed every breakable object that passed through his hands. Time had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moderated his early impulse for growth and he was a man of average height marked by smallpox </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scars, but his amazing power for manual destruction remained intact. He broke so many plates, even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without touching them, that Fernanda decided to buy him a set of pewterware before he did away </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the last pieces of her expensive china, and even the resistant metal plates were soon dented and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twisted. But to make up for that irremediable power, which was exasperating even for him, he had a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cordiality that won the immediate confidence of others and a stupendous capacity for work. In a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">short time he had increased the production of ice to such a degree that it was too much for the local </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">market and Aureliano Triste had to think about the possibility of expanding the business to other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">towns in the swamp. It was then that he thought of the decisive step, not only for the modernization </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his business but to link the town with the rest of the world. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have to bring in the railroad,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the first time that the word had ever been heard in Macondo. Looking at the sketch </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Aureliano Triste drew on the table and that was a direct descendent of the plans with which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia had illustrated his project for solar warfare, Ursula confirmed her impression </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that time was going in a circle. But unlike his forebear, Aureliano Triste did not lose any sleep or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appetite nor did he torment anyone with crises of ill humor, but he considered the most harebrained </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of projects as immediate possibilities, made rational calculations about costs and dates, and brought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them off without any intermediate exasperation. If Aureliano Segundo had something of his great&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandfather in him and lacked something of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, it was an absolute </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">indifference to mockery, and he gave the money to bring the railroad with the same lighthearted air </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with which he had given it for his brother&rsquo;s absurd navigation project. Aureliano Triste consulted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the calendar and left the following Wednesday, planning to return after the rains had passed. There </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was no more news of him. Aureliano Centeno, overwhelmed by the abundance of the factory, had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">already begun to experiment with the production of ice with a base of fruit juices instead of water, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and without knowing it or thinking about it, he conceived the essential fundamentals for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invention of sherbet. In that way he planned to diversify the production of an enterprise he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">considered his own, because his brother showed no signs of returning after the rains had passed and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a whole summer had gone by with no news of him. At the start of another winter, however, a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman who was washing clothes in the river during the hottest time of the day ran screaming down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the main street in an alarming state of commotion. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; she finally explained. &ldquo;Something frightful, like a kitchen dragging a village behind </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment the town was shaken by a whistle with a fearful echo and a loud, panting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">respiration. During the previous weeks they had seen the gangs who were laying ties and tracks and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no one paid attention to them because they thought it was some new trick of the gypsies, coming </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back with whistles and tambourines and their age-old and discredited song and dance about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">qualities of some concoction put together by journeyman geniuses of Jerusalem. But when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recovered from the noise of the whistles and the snorting, all the inhabitants ran out into the street </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and saw Aureliano Triste waving from the locomotive, and in a trance they saw the flower-bedecked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">train which was arriving for the first time eight months late. The innocent yellow train that was to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bring so many ambiguities and certainties, so many pleasant and unpleasant moments, so many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">changes, calamities, and feelings of nostalgia to Macondo. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ill </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 12 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DAZZLED BY SO MANY and such marvelous inventions, the people of Macondo did not know where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their amazement began. They stayed up all night looking at the pale electric bulbs fed by the plant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Aureliano Triste had brought back when the train made its second trip, and it took time and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">effort for them to grow accustomed to its obsessive toom-toom. They be. came indignant over the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">living images that the prosperous merchant Bmno Crespi projected in the theater with the lion-head </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ticket windows, for the character who had died and was buried in one film and for whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">misfortune tears of affliction had been shed would reappear alive and transformed into an Arab in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the next one. The audience, who paid two cents apiece to share the difficulties of the actors, would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not tolerate that outlandish fraud and they broke up the seats. The mayor, at the urging of Bruno </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Crespi, explained in a proclamation that the cinema was a machine of illusions that did not merit the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">emotional outbursts of the audience. With that discouraging explanation many felt that they had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been the victims of some new and showy gypsy business and they decided not to return to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">movies, considering that they already had too many troubles of their own to weep over the acted-out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">misfortunes of imaginary beings. Something similar happened with the cylinder phonographs that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the merry matrons from France brought with them as a substitute for the antiquated hand organs </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and that for a time had serious effects on the livelihood of the band of musicians. At first curiosity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">increased the clientele on the forbidden street and there was even word of respectable ladies who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disguised themselves as workers in order to observe the novelty of the phonograph from first hand, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but from so much and such close observation they soon reached the conclusion that it was not an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enchanted mill as everyone had thought and as the matrons had said, but a mechanical trick that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could not be compared with something so moving, so human, and so full of everyday truth as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">band of musicians. It was such a serious disappointment that when phonographs became so popular </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that there was one in every house they were not considered objects for amusement for adults but as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">something good for children to take apart. On the other hand, when someone from the town had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the opportunity to test the crude reality of the telephone installed in the railroad station, which was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought to be a mdimentary version of the phonograph because of its crank, even the most </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">incredulous were upset. It was as if God had decided to put to the test every capacity for surprise </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and was keeping the inhabitants of Macondo in a permanent alternation between excitement and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disappointment, doubt and revelation, to such an extreme that no one knew for certain where the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">limits of reality lay. It was an intricate stew of truths and mirages that convulsed the ghost of Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree with impatience and made him wander all through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house even in broad daylight. Ever since the railroad had been officially inaugurated and had begun </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to arrive with regularity on Wednesdays at eleven o&rsquo;clock and the primitive wooden station with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">desk, a telephone, and a ticket window had been built, on the streets of Macondo men and women </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were seen who had adopted everyday and normal customs and manners but who really looked like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people out of a circus. In a town that had chafed under the tricks of the gypsies there was no future </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for those ambulatory acrobats of commerce who with equal effrontery offered a whistling kettle and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a daily regime that would assure the salvation of the soul on the seventh day; but from those who let </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">themselves be convinced out of fatigue and the ones who were always unwary, they reaped </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stupendous benefits. Among those theatrical creatures, wearing riding breeches and leggings, a pith </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">helmet and steel-rimmed glasses, with topaz eyes and the skin of a thin rooster, there arrived in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo on one of so many Wednesdays the chubby and smiling Mr. Herbert, who ate at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">112 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one had noticed him at the table until the first bunch of bananas had been eaten. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo had come across him by chance as he protested In broken Spanish because there were no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rooms at the Hotel Jacob, and as he frequently did with strangers, he took him home. He was in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">captive-balloon business, which had taken him halfway around the world with excellent profits, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he had not succeeded in taking anyone up in Macondo because they considered that invention </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">backward after having seen and tried the gypsies&rsquo; flying carpets. He was leaving, therefore, on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">next train. When they brought to the table the tiger-striped bunch of bananas that they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accustomed to hang in the dining room during lunch, he picked the first piece of fruit without great </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enthusiasm. But he kept on eating as he spoke, tasting, chewing, more with the distraction of a wise </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man than with the delight of a good eater, and when he finished the first bunch he asked them to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bring him another. Then he took a small case with optical instruments out of the toolbox that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">always carried with him. With the auspicious attention of a diamond merchant he examined the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">banana meticulously, dissecting it with a special scalpel, weighing the pieces on a pharmacist&rsquo;s scale, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and calculating its breadth with a gunsmith&rsquo;s calipers. Then he took a series of instruments out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the chest with which he measured the temperature, the level of humidity in the atmosphere, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intensity of the light. It was such an intriguing ceremony that no one could eat in peace as everybody </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waited for Mr. Herbert to pass a final and revealing judgment, but he did not say anything that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">allowed anyone to guess his intentions. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the days that followed he was seen with a net and a small basket hunting butterflies on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">outskirts of town. On Wednesday a group of engineers, agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and surveyors arrived who for several weeks explored the places where Mr. Herbert had hunted his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">butterflies. Later on Mr. Jack Brown arrived in an extra coach that had been coupled onto the yellow </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">train and that was silver-plated all over, with seats of episcopal velvet, and a roof of blue glass. Also </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arriving on the special car, fluttering around Mr. Brown, were the solemn lawyers dressed in black </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who in different times had followed Colonel Aureliano Buendia everywhere, and that led the people </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to think that the agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors, like Mr. Herbert with his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">captive balloons and his colored butterflies and Mr. Brown with his mausoleum on wheels and his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ferocious German shepherd dogs, had something to do with the war. There was not much time to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">think about it, however, because the suspicious inhabitants of Macondo barely began to wonder </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what the devil was going on when the town had already become transformed into an encampment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of wooden houses with zinc roofs inhabited by foreigners who arrived on the train from halfway </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">around the world, riding not only on the seats and platforms but even on the roof of the coaches. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gringos, who later on brought their languid wives in muslin dresses and large veiled hats, built a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">separate town across the railroad tracks with streets lined with palm trees, houses with screened win&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dows, small white tables on the terraces, and fans mounted on the ceilings, and extensive blue lawns </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with peacocks and quails. The section was surrounded by a metal fence topped with a band of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">electrified chicken wire which during the cool summer mornings would be black with roasted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">swallows. No one knew yet what they were after, or whether they were actually nothing but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">philanthropists, and they had already caused a colossal disturbance, much more than that of the old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gypsies, but less transitory and understandable. Endowed with means that had been reserved for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Divine Providence in former times, they changed the pattern of the rams, accelerated the cycle of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">harvest, and moved the river from where it had always been and put it with its white stones and icy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">currents on the other side of the town, behind the cemetery. It was at that time that they built a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fortress of reinforced concrete over the faded tomb of Jose Arcadio, so that the corpses smell of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">powder would not contaminate the waters. For the foreigners who arrived without love they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">converted the street of the loving matrons from France into a more extensive village than it had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been, and on one glorious Wednesday they brought in a trainload of strange whores, Babylonish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">women skilled in age-old methods and in possession of all manner of unguents and devices to </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">113 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stimulate the unaroused, to give courage to the timid, to satiate the voracious, to exalt the modest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man, to teach a lesson to repeaters, and to correct solitary people. The Street of the Turks, enriched </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by well-lit stores with products from abroad, displacing the old bazaars with their bright colors, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">overflowed on Saturday nights with the crowds of adventurers who bumped into each other among </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gambling tables, shooting galleries, the alley where the future was guessed and dreams interpreted, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and tables of fried food and drinks, and on Sunday mornings there were scattered on the ground </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bodies that were sometimes those of happy dmnkards and more often those of onlookers felled by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shots, fists, knives, and bottles during the brawls. It was such a tumultuous and intemperate invasion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that during the first days it was impossible to walk through the streets because of the furniture and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trunks, and the noise of the carpentry of those who were building their houses in any vacant lot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without asking anyone&rsquo;s permission, and the scandalous behavior of couples who hung their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hammocks between the almond trees and made love under the netting in broad daylight and in view </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of everyone. The only serene corner had been established by peaceful West Indian Negroes, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">built a marginal street with wooden houses on piles where they would sit in the doors at dusk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">singing melancholy hymns in their disordered gabble. So many changes took place in such a short </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time that eight months after Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s visit the old inhabitants had a hard time recognizing their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">own town. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look at the mess we&rsquo;ve got ourselves into,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia said at that time, &ldquo;just </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because we invited a gringo to eat some bananas.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, could not contain his happiness over the avalanche of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreigners. The house was suddenly filled with unknown guests, with invincible and worldly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carousers, and it became necessary to add bedrooms off the courtyard, widen the dining room, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exchange the old table for one that held sixteen people, with new china and silver, and even then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had to eat lunch in shifts. Fernanda had to swallow her scmples and their guests of the worst </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sort like kings as they muddied the porch with their boots, urinated in the garden, laid their mats </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down anywhere to take their siesta, and spoke without regard for the sensitivities of ladies or the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proper behavior of gentlemen. Amaranta, was so scandalized with the plebeian invasion that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went back to eating in the kitchen as in olden days. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, convinced that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">majority of those who came into Inis workshop to greet him were not doing it because of sympathy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">or regard but out of the curiosity to meet a historical relic, a museum fossil, decided to shut himself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in by barring the door and he was not seen any more except on very rare occasions when he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sit at the street door. Ursula, on the other hand, even during the days when she was already dragging </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her feet and walking about groping along the walls, felt a juvenile excitement as the time for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arrival of the train approached. &ldquo;We have to prepare some meat and fish,&rdquo; she would order the four </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cooks, who hastened to have everything ready under the imperturbable direction of Santa Sofia de la </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Piedad. &ldquo;We have to prepare everything,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;because we never know what these strangers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">like to eat.&rdquo; The train arrived during the hottest time of day. At lunchtime the house shook with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bustle of a marketplace, and the perspiring guests&mdash;who did not even know who their hosts were&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trooped in to occupy the best places at the table, while the cooks bumped into each other with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enormous kettles of soup, pots of meat, large gourds filled with vegetables, and troughs of rice, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passed around the contents of barrels of lemonade with inexhaustible ladles. The disorder was such </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Fernanda was troubled by the idea that many were eating twice and on more than one occasion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she was about to burst out with a vegetable hawker&rsquo;s insults because someone at the table in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confusion asked her for the check. More than a year had gone by since Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s visit and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only thing that was known was that the gringos were planning to plant banana trees in the enchanted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">region that Jose Arcadio Buendia and his men had crossed in search of the route to the great </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inventions. Two other sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, with the cross of ashes on their </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">114 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreheads, arrived, drawn by that great volcanic belch, and they justified their determination with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">phrase that may have explained everybody&rsquo;s reasons. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We came,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;because everyone is coming.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty was the only one who was immune to the banana plague. She was becalmed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in a magnificent adolescence, more and more impenetrable to formality, more and more indifferent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to malice and suspicion, happy in her own world of simple realities. She did not understand why </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">women complicated their lives with corsets and petticoats, so she sewed herself a coarse cassock that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she simply put over her and without further difficulties resolved the problem of dress, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taking away the feeling of being naked, which according to her lights was the only decent way to be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when at home. They bothered her so much to cut the rain of hair that already reached to her thighs </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and to make rolls with combs and braids with red ribbons that she simply shaved her head and used </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the hair to make wigs for the saints. The startling thing about her simplifying instinct was that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more she did away with fashion in a search for comfort and the more she passed over conventions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as she obeyed spontaneity, the more disturbing her incredible beauty became and the more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">provocative she became to men. When the sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa were in Macondo for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the first time, Ursula remembered that in their veins they bore the same blood as her great- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">granddaughter and she shuddered with a forgotten fright. &ldquo;Keep your eyes wide open,&rdquo; she warned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her. &ldquo;With any of them your children will come out with the tail of a pig.&rdquo; The girl paid such little </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention to the warning that she dressed up as a man and rolled around in the sand in order to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">climb the greased pole, and she was at the point of bringing on a tragedy among the seventeen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cousins, who were driven mad by the unbearable spectacle. That was why none of them slept at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house when they visited the town and the four who had stayed lived in rented rooms at Ursula&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insistence. Remedios the Beauty, however, would have died laughing if she had known about that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">precaution. Until her last moment on earth she was unaware that her irreparable fate as a disturbing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman was a daily disaster. Every time she appeared in the dining room, against Ursula&rsquo;s orders, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">caused a panic of exasperation among the outsiders. It was all too evident that she was completely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">naked underneath her crude nightshirt and no one could understand that her shaved and perfect </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">skull was not some kind of challenge, and that the boldness with which she uncovered her thighs to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cool off was not a criminal provocation, nor was her pleasure when she sucked her fingers after, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eating. What no member of the family ever knew was that the strangers did not take long to realize </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Remedios the Beauty gave off a breath of perturbation, a tormenting breeze that was still </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perceptible several hours after she had passed by. Men expert in the disturbances of love, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">experienced all over the world, stated that they had never suffered an anxiety similar to the one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">produced by the natural smell of Remedios the Beauty. On the porch with the begonias, in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parlor, in any place in the house, it was possible to point out the exact place where she had been and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the time that had passed since she had left it. It was a definite, unmistakable trace that no one in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">family could distinguish because it had been incorporated into the daily odors for a long time, but it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was one that the outsiders identified immediately. They were the only ones, therefore, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understood how the young commander of the guard had died of love and how a gentleman from a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">faraway land had been plunged into desperation. Unaware of the restless circle in which she moved, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the unbearable state of intimate calamity that she provoked as she passed by, Remedios the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beauty treated the men without the least bit of malice and in the end upset them with her innocent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complaisance. When Ursula succeeded in imposing the command that she eat with Amaranta in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kitchen so that the outsiders would not see her, she felt more comfortable, because, after all, she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beyond all discipline. In reality, it made no difference to her where she ate, and not at regular hours </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but according to the whims of her appetite. Sometimes she would get up to have lunch at three in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the morning, sleep all day long, and she spent several months with her timetable all in disarray until </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">some casual incident would bring her back into the order of tilings. When things were going better </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">115 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she would get up at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning and shut herself up until two o&rsquo;clock, completely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nude, in the bathroom, killing scorpions as she came out of her dense and prolonged sleep. Then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she would throw water from the cistern over herself with a gourd. It was an act so prolonged, so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">meticulous, so rich in ceremonial aspects that one who did not know her well would have thought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she was given over to the deserved adoration of her own body. For her, however, that solitary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rite lacked all sensuality and was simply a way of passing the time until she was hungry. One day, as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she began to bathe herself, a stranger lifted a tile from the roof and was breathless at the tremendous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spectacle of her nudity. She saw his desolate eyes through the broken tiles and had no reaction of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shame but rather one of alarm. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll fall.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just wanted to see you,&rdquo; the foreigner murmured. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But be careful, those tiles are rotten.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The stranger&rsquo;s face had a pained expression of stupor and he seemed to be battling silently </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">against his primary instincts so as not to break up the mirage. Remedios the Beauty thought that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was suffering from the fear that the tiles would break and she bathed herself more quickly than usual </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so that the man would not be in danger. While she was pouring water from the, cistern she told him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the roof was in that state because she thought that the bed of leaves had been rotted by the rain </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and that was what was filling the bathroom with scorpions. The stranger thought that her small talk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a way of covering her complaisance, so that when she began to soap herself he gave into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">temptation and went a step further. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me soap you,&rdquo; he murmured. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you for your good intentions,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but my two hands are quite enough.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s just your back,&rdquo; the foreigner begged. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would be silly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People never soap their backs.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, while she was drying herself, the stranger begged her, with his eyes full of tears, to marry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him. She answered him sincerely that she would never marry a man who was so simple that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasted almost an hour and even went without lunch just to see a woman taking a bath. Finally, when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she put on her cassock, the man could not bear the proof that, indeed, she was not wearing anything </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">underneath, as everyone had suspected, and he felt himself marked forever with the white-hot iron </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of that secret. Then he took two more tiles off in order to drop down into the bathroom. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very high,&rdquo; she warned him in fright. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll kill yourself!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rotten tiles broke with a noise of disaster and the man barely had time to let out a cry of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">terror as he cracked his skull and was killed outright on the cement floor. The foreigners who heard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the noise in the dining room and hastened to remove the body noticed the suffocating odor of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty on his skin. It was so deep in his body that the cracks in his skull did not give </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off blood but an amber-colored oil that was impregnated with that secret perfume, and then they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">understood that the smell of Remedios the Beauty kept on torturing men beyond death, right down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the dust of their bones. Nevertheless, they did not relate that horrible accident to the other two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">men who had died because of Remedios the Beauty. A victim was still needed before the outsiders </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and many of the old inhabitants of Macondo would credit the legend that Remedios Buendia did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">give off a breath of love but a fatal emanation. The occasion for the proof of it came some months </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">later on one afternoon when Remedios the Beauty went with a group of girl friends to look at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">new plantings. For the girls of Macondo that novel game was reason for laughter and surprises, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frights and jokes, and at night they would talk about their walk as if it had been an experience in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dream. Such was the prestige of that silence that Ursula did not have the heart to take the fun away </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from Remedios the Beauty, and she let her go one afternoon, providing that she wore a hat and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decent dress. As soon as the group of friends went into the plantings the air became impregnated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a fatal fragrance. The men who were working along the rows felt possessed by a strange </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">116 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fascination, menaced by some invisible danger, and many succumbed to a terrible desire to weep. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty and her startled friends managed to take refuge in a nearby house just as they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were about to be assaulted by a pack of ferocious males. A short time later they were rescued by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flour Aurelianos, whose crosses of ash inspired a sacred respect, as if they were caste marks, stamps </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of invulnerability. Remedios the Beauty did not tell anyone that one of the men, taking advantage of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the tumult, had managed to attack her stomach with a hand that was more like the claw of an eagle </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clinging to the edge of a precipice. She faced the attacker in a kind of instantaneous flash and saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the disconsolate eyes, which remained stamped on her heart like the hot coals of pity. That night the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man boasted of his audacity and swaggered over his good luck on the Street of the Turks a few </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">minutes before the kick of a horse cmshed his chest and a crowd of outsiders saw him die in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">middle of the street, drowned in his own bloody vomiting. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The supposition that Remedios the Beauty Possessed powers of death was then borne out by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">four irrefutable events. Although some men who were easy with their words said that it was worth </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sacrificing one&rsquo;s life for a night of love with such an arousing woman, the tmth was that no one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made any effort to do so. Perhaps, not only to attain her but also to conjure away her dangers, all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was needed was a feeling as primitive and as simple as that of love, but that was the only thing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that did not occur to anyone. Ursula did not worry about her any more. On another occasion, when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had not yet given up the idea of saving her for the world, she had tried to get her interested in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">basic domestic affairs. &ldquo;Men demand much more than you think,&rdquo; she would tell her enigmatically. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of cooking, a lot of sweeping, a lot of suffering over little things beyond what you </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">think.&rdquo; She was deceiving herself within, trying to train her for domestic happiness because she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced that once his passion was satisfied them would not be a man on the face of the earth </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">capable of tolerating even for a day a negligence that was beyond all understanding. The birth of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">latest Jose Arcadio and her unshakable will to bring him up to be Pope finally caused her to cease </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worrying about her great-granddaughter. She abandoned her to her fate, trusting that sooner or later </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a miracle would take place and that in this world of everything there would also be a man with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough sloth to put up with her. For a long time already Amaranta had given up trying to make her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a useful woman. Since those forgotten afternoons when her niece barely had enough interest to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">turn the crank on the sewing machine, she had reached the conclusion that she was simpleminded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Were going to have to raffle you off,&rdquo; she would tell her, perplexed at the fact that men&rsquo;s words </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would not penetrate her. Later on, when Ursula insisted that Remedios the Beauty go to mass with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her face covered with a shawl, Amaranta thought that a mysterious recourse like that would turn out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to be so provoking that soon a man would come who would be intrigued enough to search out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patiently for the weak point of her heart. But when she saw the stupid way in which she rejected a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pretender who for many reasons was more desirable than a prince, she gave up all hope. Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not even make any attempt to understand her. When she saw Remedios the Beauty dressed as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">queen at the bloody carnival she thought that she was an extraordinary creature. But when she saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her eating with her hands, incapable of giving an answer that was not a miracle of simplemind&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">edness, the only thing that she lamented was the fact that the idiots in the family lived so long. In </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spite of the fact that Colonel Aureliano Buendia kept on believing and repeating that Remedios the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beauty was in reality the most lucid being that he had ever known and that she showed it at every </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment with her startling ability to put things over on everyone, they let her go her own way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty stayed there wandering through the desert of solitude, bearing no cross on her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back, maturing in her dreams without nightmares, her interminable baths, her unscheduled meals, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her deep and prolonged silences that had no memory until one afternoon in March, when Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted to fold her brabant sheets in the garden and asked the women in the house for help. She had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">just begun when Amaranta noticed that Remedios the Beauty was covered all over by an intense </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">paleness. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">117 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel well?&rdquo; she asked her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty, who was clutching the sheet by the other end, gave a pitying smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quite the opposite,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I never felt better.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had just finished saying it when Fernanda felt a delicate wind of light pull the sheets out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her hands and open them up wide. Amaranta felt a mysterious trembling in the lace on her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">petticoats and she tried to grasp the sheet so that she would not fall down at the instant in which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty began to rise. Ursula, almost blind at the time, was the only person who was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sufficiently calm to identify the nature of that determined wind and she left the sheets to the mercy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the light as she watched Remedios the Beauty waving good-bye in the midst of the flapping </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sheets that rose up with her, abandoning with her the environment of beetles and dahlias and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passing through the air with her as four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon came to an end, and they were lost </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forever with her in the upper atmosphere where not even the highest-flying birds of memory could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reach her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outsiders, of course, thought that Remedios the Beauty had finally succumbed to her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">irrevocable fate of a queen bee and that her family was trying to save her honor with that tale of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">levitation. Fernanda, burning with envy, finally accepted the miracle, and for a long time she kept on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">praying to God to send her back her sheets. Most people believed in the miracle and they even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lighted candles and celebrated novenas. Perhaps there might have been talk of nothing else for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">long time if the barbarous extermination of the Aurelianos had not replaced amazement with honor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he had never thought of it as an omen, Colonel Aureliano Buendia had foreseen the tragic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">end of his sons in a certain way. When Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya, the two who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arrived during the tumult, expressed a wish to stay in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fie could not understand what they were going to do in a town that had been transformed into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dangerous place overnight. But Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, backed by Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo. gave them work in their businesses. Colonel Aureliano Buendia had reasons that were still </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very confused and were against that determination. When he saw Mr. Brown in the first automobile </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to reach Macondo&mdash;an orange convertible with a horn that frightened dogs with its bark&mdash;the old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soldier grew indignant with the servile excitement of the people and he realized that something had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">changed in the makeup of the men since the days when they would leave their wives and children </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and toss a shotgun on their shoulders to go off to war. The local authorities, after the armistice of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neerlandia, were mayors without initiative, decorative judges picked from among the peaceful and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tired Conservatives of Macondo. &ldquo;This is a regime of wretches,&rdquo; Colonel Aureliano Buendia would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">comment when he saw the barefoot policemen armed with wooden clubs pass. &ldquo;We fought all those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wars and all of it just so that we didn&rsquo;t have to paint our houses blue.&rdquo; When the banana company </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arrived, however, the local functionaries were replaced by dictatorial foreigners whom Mr. Brown </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought to live in the electrified chicken yard so that they could enjoy, as he explained it, the dignity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that their status warranted and so that they would not suffer from the heat and the mosquitoes and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the countless discomforts and privations of the town. The old policemen were replaced by hired </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">assassins with machetes. Shut up in his workshop, Colonel Aureliano Buendia thought about those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">changes and for the first time in his quiet years of solitude he was tormented by the definite certainty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it had been a mistake not to have continued the war to its final conclusion. During that time a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brother of the forgotten Colonel Magnlfico Visbal was taking his seven-year-old grandson to get a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soft drink at one of the pushcarts on the square and because the child accidentally bumped into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">corporal of police and spilled the drink on his uniform, the barbarian cut him to pieces with his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">machete, and with one stroke he cut off the head of the grandfather as he tried to stop him. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whole town saw the decapitated man pass by as a group of men carried him to his house, with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman dragging the head along by its hair, and the bloody sack with the pieces of the child. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">118 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Colonel Aureliano Buendia it meant the limits of atonement. He suddenly found himself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suffering from the same indignation that he had felt in his youth over the body of the woman who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been beaten to death because she had been bitten by a rabid dog. He looked at the groups of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bystanders in front of the house and with his old stentorian voice, restored by a deep disgust with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself, he unloaded upon them the burden of hate that he could no longer bear in his heart. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One of these days,&rdquo; he shouted, I&rsquo;m going to arm my boys so we can get rid of these shitty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gringos!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the course of that week, at different places along the coast, his seventeen sons were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hunted down like rabbits by invisible criminals who aimed at the center of their crosses of ash. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Triste was leaving the house with his mother at seven in the evening when a rifle shot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came out of the darkness and perforated his forehead. Aureliano Centeno was found in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hammock that he was accustomed to hang up in the factory with an icepick between his eyebrows </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">driven in up to the handle. Aureliano Serrador had left his girl friend at her parents&rsquo; house after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">having taken her to the movies and was returning through the well-lighted Street of the Turks when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">someone in the crowd who was never identified fired a revolver shot which knocked him over into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">caldron of boiling lard. A few minutes later someone knocked at the door of the room where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Arcaya was shut up with a woman and shouted to him: &ldquo;Hurry up, they&rsquo;re killing your </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brothers.&rdquo; The woman who was with him said later that Aureliano Arcaya jumped out of bed and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opened the door and was greeted with the discharge of a Mauser that split his head open. On that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night of death, while the house was preparing to hold a wake for the four corpses, Fernanda ran </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the town like a madwoman looking for Aureliano Segundo, whom Petra Cotes had locked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up in a closet, thinking that the order of extermination included all who bore the colonel&rsquo;s name. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She would not let him out until the fourth day, when the telegrams received from different places </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">along the coast made it clear that the fury of the invisible enemy was directed only at the brothers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marked with the crosses of ash. Amaranta fetched the ledger where she had written down the facts </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about her nephews and as the telegrams arrived she drew lines through the names until only that of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the eldest remained. They remembered him very well because of the contrast between his dark skin </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and his green eyes. His name was Aureliano Amador and he was a carpenter, living in a village </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hidden in the foothills. After waiting two weeks for the telegram telling of his death, Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo sent a messenger to him in order to warn him, thinking that he might not know about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">threat that hung over him. The emissary returned with the news that Aureliano Amador was safe. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night of the extermination two men had gone to get him at his house and had shot at him with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their revolvers but they had missed the cross of ashes. Aureliano Amador had been able to leap over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the wall of the courtyard and was lost in the labyrinth of the mountains, which he knew like the back </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his hand thanks to the friendship he maintained with the Indians, from whom he bought wood. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing more was heard of him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those were dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendia. The president of the republic sent him a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">telegram of condolence in which he promised an exhaustive investigation and paid homage to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dead men. At his command, the mayor appeared at the services with four funeral wreaths, which he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tried to place on the coffins, but the colonel ordered him into the street. After the burial he drew up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and personally submitted to the president of the republic a violent telegram, which the telegrapher </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">refused to send. Then he enriched it with terms of singular aggressiveness, put it in an envelope, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mailed it. As had happened with the death of his wife, as had happened to him so many times during </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the war with the deaths of his best friends, he did not have a feeling of sorrow but a blind and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">directionless rage, a broad feeling of impotence. He even accused Father Antonio Isabel of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complicity for having marked his sons with indelible ashes so that they-could be identified by their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enemies. The decrepit priest, who could no longer string ideas together and who was beginning to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">startle his parishioners with the wild interpretations he gave from the pulpit, appeared one afternoon </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">119 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at the house with the goblet in which he had prepared the ashes that Wednesday and he tried to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anoint the whole family with them to show that they could be washed off with water. But the horror </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the misfortune had penetrated so deeply that not even Fernanda would let him experiment on her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and never again was a Buendia seen to kneel at the altar rail on Ash Wednesday. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not recover his calm for a long time. He abandoned the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manufacture of little fishes, ate with great difficulty, and wandered all through the house as if </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walking in his sleep, dragging his blanket and chewing on his quiet rage. At the end of three months </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his hair was ashen, his old waxed mustache poured down beside his colorless lips, but, on the other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hand, his eyes were once more the burning coals that had startled those who had seen him born and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that in other days had made chairs rock with a simple glance. In the fury of his torment he tried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">futilely to rouse the omens that had guided his youth along dangerous paths into the desolate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasteland of glory. He was lost, astray in a strange house where nothing and no one now stirred in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him the slightest vestige of affection. Once he opened Melquiades&rsquo; room, looking for the traces of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">past from before the war, and he found only mbble, trash, piles of waste accumulated over all the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">years of abandonment. Between the covers of the books that no one had ever read again, in the old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parchments damaged by dampness, a livid flower had prospered, and in the air that had been the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">purest and brightest in the house an unbearable smell of rotten memories floated. One morning he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found Ursula weeping under the chestnut tree at the knees of her dead husband. Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia was the only inhabitant of the house who still did not see the powerful old man who had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been beaten down by half a century in the open air. &ldquo;Say hello to your father,&rdquo; Ursula told him. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stopped for an instant in front of the chestnut tree and once again he saw that the empty space </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before him did not arouse an affection either. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; he asked. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very sad,&rdquo; Ursula answered, &ldquo;because he thinks that you&rsquo;re going to die.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; the colonel said, smiling, &ldquo;that a person doesn&rsquo;t die when he should but when he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">can.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The omen of the, dead father stirred up the last remnant of pride that was left in his heart, but he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confused it with a sudden gust of strength. It was for that reason that he hounded Ursula to tell him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where in the courtyard the gold coins that they had found inside the plaster Saint Joseph were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">buried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know,&rdquo; she told him with a firmness inspired by an old lesson. &ldquo;One day,&rdquo; she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">added, &ldquo;the owner of that fortune will appear and only he can dig it up.&rdquo; No one knew why a man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who had always been so generous had begun to covet money with such anxiety, and not the modest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">amounts that would have been enough to resolve an emergency, but a fortune of such mad size that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the mere mention of it left Aureliano Segundo awash in amazement. His old fellow party members, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to whom he went asking for help, hid so as not to receive him. It was around that time that he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heard to say. &ldquo;The only difference today between Liberals and Conservatives is that the Liberals go </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to mass at five o&rsquo;clock and the Conservatives at eight.&rdquo; Nevertheless he insisted with such </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perseverance, begged in such a way, broke his code of dignity to such a degree, that with a little help </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from here and a little more from there, sneaking about everywhere, with a slippery diligence and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pitiless perseverance, he managed to put together in eight months more money than Ursula had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">buried. Then he visited the ailing Colonel Gerineldo Marquez so that he would help him start the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">total war. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a certain time Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was really the only one who could have pulled, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even from his paralytics chair, the musty strings of rebellion. After the armistice of Neerlandia, while </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia took refuge with his little gold fishes, he kept in touch with the rebel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officers who had been faithful to him until the defeat. With them he waged the sad war of daily </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">humiliation, of entreaties and petitions, of come-back-tomorrow, of any-time-now, of we&rsquo;re- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">studying-your-case-with-the-proper-attention; the war hopelessly lost against the many yours-most- </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">120 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trulys who should have signed and would never sign the lifetime pensions. The other war, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bloody one of twenty years, did not cause them as much damage as the corrosive war of eternal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">postponements. Even Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, who escaped three attempts on his life, survived </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">five wounds, and emerged unscathed from innumerable battles, succumbed to that atrocious siege of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting and sank into the miserable defeat of old age, thinking of Amaranta among the diamond&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shaped patches of light in a borrowed house. The last veterans of whom he had word had appeared </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">photographed in a newspaper with their faces shamelessly raised beside an anonymous president of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the republic who gave them buttons with Inis likeness on them to wear in their lapels and returned to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them a flag soiled with blood and gunpowder so that they could place it on their coffins. The others, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more honorable, were still waiting for a letter in the shadow of public charity, dying of hunger, living </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through rage, ratting of old age amid the exquisite shit of glory. So that when Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia invited him to start a mortal conflagration that would wipe out all vestiges of a regime of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">corruption and scandal backed by the foreign invader, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez could not hold </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back a shudder of compassion. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Aureliano,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I already knew that you were old, but now I realize that you&rsquo;re a lot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">older than you look.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">121 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 13 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">IN THE BEWILDERMENT of her last years, Ursula had had very little free time to attend to the papal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">education of Jose Arcadio, and the time came for him to get ready to leave for the seminary right </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">away. Meme, his sister, dividing her time between Fernanda&rsquo;s rigidity and Amaranta&rsquo;s bitterness, at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost the same moment reached the age set for her to be sent to the nuns&rsquo; school, where they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would make a virtuoso on the clavichord of her. Ursula felt tormented by grave doubts concerning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the effectiveness of the methods with which she had molded the spirit of the languid apprentice </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Supreme Pontiff, but she did not put the blame on her staggering old age or the dark clouds that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barely permitted her to make out the shape of things, but on something that she herself could not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">really define and that she conceived confusedly as a progressive breakdown of time. &ldquo;The years </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nowadays don&rsquo;t pass the way the old ones used to,&rdquo; she would say, feeling that everyday reality was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slipping through her hands. In the past, she thought, children took a long time to grow up. All one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had to do was remember all the time needed for Jose Arcadio, the elder, to go away with the gypsies </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and all that happened before he came back painted like a snake and talking like an astronomer, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the things that happened in the house before Amaranta and Arcadio forgot the language of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indians and learned Spanish. One had to see only the days of sun and dew that poor Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia went through under the chestnut tree and all the time weeded to mourn his death before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they brought in a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who after so much war and so much suffering </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from it was still not fifty years of age. In other times, after spending the whole day making candy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">animals, she had more than enough time for the children, to see from the whites of their eyes that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they needed a dose of castor oil. Now, however, when she had nothing to do and would go about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with Jose Arcadio riding on her hip from dawn to dusk, this bad kind of time compelled her to leave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">things half done. The truth was that Ursula resisted growing old even when she had already lost </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">count of her age and she was a bother on all sides as she tried to meddle in everything and as she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">annoyed strangers with her questions as to whether they had left a plaster Saint Joseph to be kept </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">until the rains were over during the days of the war. No one knew exactly when she had begun to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lose her sight. Even in her later years, when she could no longer get out of bed, it seemed that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was simply defeated by decrepitude, but no one discovered that she was blind. She had noticed it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before the birth of Jose Arcadio. At first she thought it was a matter of a passing debility and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secretly took marrow syrup and put honey on her eyes, but quite soon she began to realize that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was irrevocably sinking into the darkness, to a point where she never had a clear notion of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invention of the electric light, for when they put in the first bulbs she was only able to perceive the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">glow. She did not tell anyone about it because it would have been a public recognition of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">uselessness. She concentrated on a silent schooling in the distances of tilings and peoples voices, so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she would still be able to see with her memory what the shadows of her cataracts no longer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">allowed her to. Later on she was to discover the unforeseen help of odors, which were defined in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the shadows with a strength that was much more convincing than that of bulk and color, and which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saved her finally from the shame of admitting defeat. In the darkness of the room she was able to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thread a needle and sew a buttonhole and she knew when the milk was about to boil. She knew with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so much certainty the location of everything that she herself forgot that she was blind at times. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one occasion Fernanda had the whole house upset because she had lost her wedding ring, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula found it on a shelf in the children&rsquo;s bedroom. Quite simply, while the others were going </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carelessly all about, she watched them with her four senses so that they never took her by surprise, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and after some time she discovered that every member of the family, without realizing it, repeated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the same path every day, the same actions, and almost repeated the same words at the same hour. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">122 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only when they deviated from meticulous routine did they run the risk of losing something. So </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when she heard Fernanda all upset be cause she had lost her ring, Ursula remembered that the only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thing different that she had done that day was to put the mattresses out in the sun because Meme </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had found a bedbug the might before. Since the children had been present at the fumigation, Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">figured that Fernanda had put the ring in the only place where they could not reach it: the shelf. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda, on the other hand, looked for it in vain along the paths of her everyday itinerary without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knowing that the search for lost tilings is hindered by routine habits and that is why it is so difficult </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to find them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rearing of Jose Arcadio helped Ursula in the exhausting task of keeping herself up to date on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the smallest changes in the house. When she realized that Amaranta was dressing the saints in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom she pretended to show the boy the differences in the colors. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; she would tell him. &ldquo;Tell me what color the Archangel Raphael is wearing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that way the child gave her the information that was denied her by her eyes, and long before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he went away to the seminary Ursula could already distinguish the different colors of the saints&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clothing by the texture. Sometimes unforeseen accidents would happen. One afternoon when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta was &lsquo;embroidering on the porch with the begonias Ursula bumped into her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Amaranta protested, &ldquo;watch where you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault,&rdquo; Ursula said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sitting where you&rsquo;re supposed to.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was sure of it. But that day she began to realize something that no one had noticed and it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that with the passage of the year the sun imperceptibly changed position and those who sat on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">porch had to change their position little by little without being aware of it. From then on Ursula had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only to remember the date in order to know exactly where Amaranta was sitting. Even though the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trembling of her hands was more and more noticeable and the weight of her feet was too much for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her, her small figure was never seen in so many places at the same time. She was almost as diligent as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when she had the whole weight of the house on her shoulders. Nevertheless, in the impenetrable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitude of decrepitude she had such clairvoyance as she examined the most insignificant happenings </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the family that for the first time she saw clearly the truths that her busy life in former times had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prevented her from seeing. Around the time they were preparing Jose Arcadio for the seminary she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had already made a detailed recapitulation of life in the house since the founding of Macondo and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had completely changed the opinion that she had always held of her descendants. She realized that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia had not lost his love for the family because he had been hardened by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">war, as she had thought before, but that he had never loved anyone, not even his wife Remedios or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the countless one-night women who had passed through his life, and much less his sons. She sensed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he had fought so many wars not out of idealism, as everyone had thought, nor had he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">renounced a certain victory because of fatigue, as everyone had thought, but that he had won and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lost for the same reason, pure and sinful pride. She reached the conclusion that the son for whom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she would have given her life was simply a man incapable of love. One night when she was carrying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him in her belly she heard him weeping. It was such a definite lament that Jose Arcadio Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woke up beside her and was happy with the idea that his son was going to be a ventriloquist. Other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people predicted that he would be a prophet. She, on the other hand, shuddered from the certainty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the deep moan was a first indication of the fearful pig tail and she begged God to let the child </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">die in her womb. But the lucidity of her old age allowed her to see, and she said so many times, that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the cries of children in their mothers&rsquo; wombs are not announcements of ventriloquism or a faculty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for prophecy but an unmistakable sign of an incapacity for love. The lowering of the image of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">son brought out in her all at once all the compassion that she owed him. Amaranta, however, whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hardness of heart frightened her, whose concentrated bitterness made her bitter, suddenly became </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clear to her in the final analysis as the most tender woman who had ever existed, and she understood </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with pitying clarity that the unjust tortures to which she had submitted Pietro Crespi had not been </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">123 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dictated by a desire for vengeance, as everyone had thought, nor had the slow martyrdom with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which she had frustrated the life of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez been determined by the gall of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bitterness, as everyone had thought, but that both actions had been a mortal struggle between a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">measureless love and an invincible cowardice, and that the irrational fear that Amaranta had always </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had of her own tormented heart had triumphed in the end. It was during that time that Ursula, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to speak Rebeca&rsquo;s name, bringing back the memory of her with an old love that was exalted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by tardy repentance and a sudden admiration, coming to understand that only she, Rebeca, the one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who had never fed of her milk but only of the earth of the land and the whiteness of the walls, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one who did not carry the blood of her veins in hers but the unknown blood of the strangers whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bones were still c/odng in their grave. Rebeca, the one with an impatient heart, the one with a fierce </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">womb, was the only one who bad the unbridled courage that Ursula had wanted for her line. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rebeca,&rdquo; she would say, feeling along the walls, &ldquo;how unfair we&rsquo;ve been to you!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the house they simply thought that her mind was wandering, especially since the time she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">begun walking about with her right arm raised like the Archangel Gabriel. Fernanda, however, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">realized that there was a sun of clairvoyance in the shadows of that wandering, for Ursula could say </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without hesitation how much money had been spent in the house during the previous year. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta had a similar idea one day as her mother was stirring a pot of soup in the kitchen and said </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all at once without knowing that they were listening to her that the corn grinder they had bought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the first gypsies and that had disappeared during the time before Jose Arcadio, had taken his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sixty-five trips around the world was still in Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s house. Also almost a hundred years old, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but fit and agile in spite of her inconceivable fatness, which frightened children as her laughter had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frightened the doves in other times. Pilar Ternera was not surprised that Ursula was correct because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her own experience was beginning to tell her that an alert old age can be more keen than the cards. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, when Ursula realized that she had not had enough time to consolidate the vocation </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Jose Arcadio, she let herself be disturbed by consternation. She began to make mistakes, trying to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">see with her eyes the tilings that intuition allowed her to see with greater clarity. One morning she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">poured the contents of an inkwell over the boy&rsquo;s head thinking that it was rose water. She stumbled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so much in her insistence in taking part in everything that she felt herself upset by gusts of bad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">humor and she tried to get rid of the shadows that were beginning to wrap her in a straitjacket of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cobwebs. It was then that it occurred to her that her clumsiness was not the first victory of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decrepitude and darkness but a sentence passed by time. She thought that previously, when God did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not make the same traps out of the months and years that the Turks used when they measured a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">yard of percale, things were different. Now children not only grew faster, but even feelings </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">developed in a different way. No sooner had Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven in body and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soul than the inconsiderate Fernanda was going about mumbling to herself because her sheets had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been carried off. The bodies of the Aurelianos were no sooner cold in their graves than Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo had the house lighted up again, filled with drunkards playing the accordion and dousing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">themselves in champagne, as if dogs and not Christians had died, and as if that madhouse which had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cost her so many headaches and so many candy animals was destined to become a trash heap of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perdition. Remembering those tilings as she prepared Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s trunk, Ursula wondered if it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was not preferable to lie down once and for all in her grave and let them throw the earth over her, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she asked God, without fear, if he really believed that people were made of iron in order to bear </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so many troubles and mortifications, and asking over and over she was stirring up her own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confusion and she felt irrepressible desires to let herself go and scamper about like a foreigner and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">allow herself at last an instant of rebellion, that instant yearned for so many times and so many times </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">postponed, putting her resignation aside and shitting on everything once and for all and drawing out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of her heart the infinite stacks of bad words that she had been forced to swallow over a century of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conformity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">124 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; she shouted. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta, who was starting to put the clothes into the trunk, thought that she had been bitten by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a scorpion. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; she asked in alarm. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The bug!&rdquo; Amaranta said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula put a finger on her heart. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On Thursday, at two in the afternoon, Jose Arcadio left for the seminary. &lsquo;Ursula would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remember him always as she said good-bye to him, languid and serious, without shedding a tear, as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had taught him, sweltering in the heat in the green corduroy suit with copper buttons and a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">starched bow around his neck. He left the dining room impregnated with the penetrating fragrance </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of rose water that she had sprinkled on his head so that she could follow his tracks through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house. While the farewell lunch was going on, the family concealed its nervousness with festive </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expressions and they celebrated with exaggerated enthusiasm the remarks that Father Antonio Isabel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made. But when they took out the trunk bound in velvet and with silver corners, it was as if they had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">taken a coffin out of the house. The only one who refused to take part in the farewell was Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we need,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;A Pope!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three months later Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda took Meme to school and came back with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clavichord, which took the place of the pianola. It was around that time that Amaranta started </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sewing her own shroud. The banana fever had calmed down. The old inhabitants of Macondo found </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">themselves surrounded by newcomers and working hard to cling to their precarious resources of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">times gone by, but comforted in any case by the sense that they had survived a shipwreck. In the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house they still had guests for lunch and the old routine was never really set up again until the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">banana company left years later. Nevertheless, there were radical changes in the traditional sense of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hospitality because at that time it was Fernanda who imposed her rules. With Ursula relegated to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shadows and with Amaranta absorbed In the work of her winding cloth, the former apprentice </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">queen had the freedom to choose the guests and impose on them the rigid norms that her parents </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had taught her. Her severity made the house a redoubt of old customs in a town convulsed by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vulgarity with which the outsiders squandered their easy fortunes. For her, with no further questions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked, proper people were those who had nothing to do with the banana company. Even Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo, her brother-in-law, was the victim of her discriminatory jealousy because during </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the excitement of the first days he gave up his stupendous fighting cocks again and took a job as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreman with the banana company. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t ever come into this house again,&rdquo; Fernanda said, &ldquo;as long as he carries the rash of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foreigners.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such was the narrowness imposed in the house that Aureliano Segundo felt more comfortable at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petra Cotes&rsquo;s. First, with the pretext of taking the burden off his wife, he transferred his parties. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with the pretext that the animals were losing their fertility, he transferred his barns and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stables. Finally, with the pretext that it was cooler in his concubine&rsquo;s house, he transferred the small </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">office in which he handled his business. When Fernanda realized that she was a widow whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband had still not died, it was already too late for things to return to their former state. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo barely ate at home and the only appearances he put in, such as to sleep with his wife, were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not enough to convince anyone. One night, out of carelessness, morning found him in Petra Cotes&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bed. Fernanda, contrary to expectations, did not reproach him in the least or give the slightest sigh </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of resentment, but on the same day she sent two trunks with his clothing to the house of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concubine. She sent them in broad daylight and with instructions that they be carried through the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">125 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">middle of the street so that everyone could see them, thinking that her straying husband would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unable to bear the shame and would return to the fold with his head hung low. But that heroic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gesture was just one more proof of how poorly Fernanda knew not only the character of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband but the character of a community that had nothing to do with that of her parents, for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everyone who saw the trunks pass by said that it was the natural culmination of a story whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intimacies were known to everyone, and Aureliano Segundo celebrated the freedom he had received </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a party that lasted for three days. To the greater disadvantage of his wife, as she was entering </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a sad maturity with her somber long dresses, her old-fashioned medals, and her out-of-place </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pride, the concubine seemed to be bursting with a second youth, clothed in gaudy dresses of natural </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">silk and with her eyes tiger-striped with a glow of vindication. Aureliano Segundo gave himself over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to her again with the fury of adolescence, as before, when Petra Cotes had not loved him for himself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but because she had him mixed up with his twin brother and as she slept with both of them at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same time she thought that God had given her the good fortune of having a man who could make </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">love like two. The restored passion was so pressing that on more than one occasion they would look </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">each other in the eyes as they were getting ready to eat and without saying anything they would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cover their plates and go into the bedroom dying of hunger and of love. Inspired by the things he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had seen on his furtive visits to the French matrons, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with an archiepiscopal canopy, put velvet curtains on the windows, and covered the ceiling and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walls of the bedroom with large rock-crystal mirrors. At the same time he was more of a carouser </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and spendthrift than ever. On the train, which arrived every day at eleven o&rsquo;clock, he would receive </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cases and more cases of champagne and brandy. On the way back from the station he would drag </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the improvised cumbiamba along in full view of all the people on the way, natives or outsiders, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">acquaintances or people yet to be known, without distinctions of any kind. Even the slippery Mr. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brown, who talked only in a strange tongue, let himself be seduced by the tempting signs that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo made him and several times he got dead dmnk in Petra Cotes&rsquo;s house and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even made the fierce German shepherd dogs that went everywhere with him dance to some Texas </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">songs that he himself mumbled in one way or another to the accompaniment of the accordion. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cease, cows,&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo shouted at the height of the party. &ldquo;Cease, because life is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">short.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He never looked better, nor had he been loved more, nor had the breeding of his animals been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wilder. There was a slaughtering of so many cows, pigs, and chickens for the endless parties that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ground in the courtyard turned black and muddy with so much blood. It was an eternal execution </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ground of bones and innards, a mud pit of leftovers, and they had to keep exploding dynamite </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bombs all the time so that the buzzards would not pluck out the guests&rsquo; eyes. Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grew fat, purple-colored, turtle-shaped, because of an appetite comparable only to that of Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio when he came back from traveling around the world. The prestige of his outlandish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">voracity, of his immense capacity as a spendthrift, of his unprecedented hospitality went beyond the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">borders of the swamp and attracted the best-qualified gluttons from all along the coast. Fabulous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eaters arrived from everywhere to take part in the irrational tourneys of capacity and resistance that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were organized in the house of Petra Cotes. Aureliano Segundo was the unconquered eater until the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">luckless Saturday when Camila Sagastume appeared, a totemic female known all through the land by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the good name of &ldquo;The Elephant.&rdquo; The duel lasted until dawn on Tuesday. During the first twenty- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">four hours, having dispatched a dinner of veal, with cassava, yams, and fried bananas, and a case and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a half of champagne in addition, Aureliano Segundo was sure of victory. He seemed more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enthusiastic, more vital than his imperturbable adversary, who possessed a style that was obviously </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more professional, but at the same time less emotional for the large crowd that filled the house. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Aureliano Segundo ate with great bites, overcome by the anxiety of victory, The Elephant was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slicing her meat with the art of a surgeon and eating it unhurriedly and even with a certain pleasure. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">126 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was gigantic and sturdy, but over her colossal form a tenderness of femininity prevailed and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had a face that was so beautiful, hands so fine and well cared for, and such an irresistible personal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">charm that when Aureliano Segundo saw her enter the house he commented in a low voice that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would have preferred to have the tourney in bed and not at the table. Later on, when he saw her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consume a side of veal without breaking a single rule of good table manners, he commented </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seriously that that delicate, fascinating, and insatiable proboscidian was in a certain way the ideal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman. He was not mistaken. The reputation of a bone crusher that had preceded The Elephant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had no basis. She was not a beef cruncher or a bearded lady from a Greek circus, as had been said, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but the director of a school of voice. She had learned to eat when she was already the respectable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mother of a family, looking for a way for her children to eat better and not by means of any artificial </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stimulation of their appetites but through the absolute tranquility of their spirits. Her theory, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">demonstrated in practice, was based on the principle that a person who had all matters of conscience </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in perfect shape should be able to eat until overcome by fatigue. And it was for moral reasons and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sporting interest that she left her school and her home to compete with a man whose fame as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">great, unprincipled eater had spread throughout the country. From the first moment she saw him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she saw that Aureliano Segundo would lose not his stomach but Iris character. At the end of the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night, while The Elephant was boldly going on, Aureliano Segundo was wearing himself out with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">great deal of talking and laughing. They slept four hours. On awakening each one had the juice of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forty oranges, eight quarts of coffee, and thirty raw eggs. On the second morning, after many hours </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without sleep and having put away two pigs, a bunch of bananas, and four cases of champagne, The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elephant suspected that Aureliano Segundo had unknowingly discovered the same method as hers, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but by the absurd route of total irresponsibility. He was, therefore, more dangerous than she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought. Nevertheless, when Petra Cotes brought two roast turkeys to the table, Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a step away from being stuffed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t eat any more,&rdquo; The Elephant said to him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call it a tie.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said it from her heart, understanding that she could not eat another mouthful either, out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remorse for bringing on the death of her adversary. But Aureliano Segundo interpreted it as another </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">challenge and he filled himself with turkey beyond his incredible capacity. He lost consciousness. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fell face down into the plate filled with bones, frothing at the mouth like a dog, and drowning in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moans of agony. He felt, in the midst of the darkness, that they were throwing him from the top of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tower into a bottomless pit and in a last flash of consciousness he realized that at the end of that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">endless fall death was waiting for him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take me to Fernanda,&rdquo; he managed to say. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His friends left him at the house thinking that they had helped him fulfill his promise to his wife </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not to die in his concubine&rsquo;s bed. Petra Cotes had shined his patent leather boots that he wanted to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wear in his coffin, and she was already looking for someone to take them when they came to tell her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Aureliano Segundo was out of danger. He did recover, indeed, in less than a week, and two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weeks later he was celebrating the fact of his survival with unprecedented festivities. He continued </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">living at Petra Cotes&rsquo;s but he would visit Fernanda every day and sometimes he would stay to eat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the family, as if fate had reversed the situation and had made him the husband of his concubine </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the lover of his wife. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a rest for Fernanda. During the boredom of her abandonment her only distractions were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the clavichord lessons at siesta time and the letters from her children. In the detailed messages that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she sent them every two weeks there was not a single line of truth. She hid her troubles from them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hid from them the sadness of a house which, in spite of the light on the begonias, in spite of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heaviness at two in the afternoon, in spite of the frequent waves of festivals that came in from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">street was more and more like the colonial mansion of her parents. Fernanda would wander alone </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">among the three living ghosts and the dead ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendia, who at times would </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">127 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come to sit down with an inquisitive attention in the half-light of the parlor while she was playing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the clavichord. Colonel Aureliano Buendia was a shadow. Since the last time that he had gone out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into the street to propose a war without any future to Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, he left the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">workshop only to urinate under the chestnut tree. He did not receive any visits except that of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barber every three weeks, He fed on anything that Ursula brought him once a day, and even though </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he kept on making little gold fishes with the same passion as before, he stopped selling them when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he found out that people were buying them not as pieces of jewelry but as historic relics. He made a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bonfire in the courtyard of the dolls of Remedios which had decorated, their bedroom since their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding. The watchful Ursula realized what her son was doing but she could not stop him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a heart of stone,&rdquo; she told him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of a heart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The room&rsquo;s getting full of moths.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta was weaving her shroud. Fernanda did not understand why she would write occasional </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letters to Meme and even send her gifts and on the other hand did not even want to hear about Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll die without knowing why,&rdquo; Amaranta answered when she was asked through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula, and that answer planted an enigma in Fernanda&rsquo;s heart that she was never able to clarify. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tall, broad-shouldered, proud, always dressed in abundant petticoats with the lace and in air of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distinction that resisted the years and bad memories, Amaranta seemed to carry the cross of ashes of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">virginity on her forehead. In reality she carried it on her hand in the black bandage, which she did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not take off even to sleep and which she washed and ironed herself. Her life was spent in weaving </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her shroud. It might have been said that she wove during the day and unwove during the night, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not with any hope of defeating solitude in that way, but, quite the contrary, in order to nurture it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The greatest worry that Fernanda had during her years of abandonment was that Meme would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come to spend her first vacation and not find Aureliano Segundo at home. His congestion had put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an end to that fear. When Meme returned, her parents had made an agreement that not only would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the girl think that Aureliano Segundo was still a domesticated husband but also that she would not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">notice the sadness of the house. Every year for two months Aureliano Segundo played his role of an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exemplary husband and he organized parties with ice cream and cookies which the gay and lively </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">schoolgirl enhanced with the clavichord. It was obvious from then on that she had inherited very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">little of her mother&rsquo;s character. She seemed more of a second version of Amaranta when the latter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not known bitterness and was arousing the house with her dance steps at the age of twelve or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fourteen before her secret passion for Pietro Crespi was to twist the direction of her heart in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">end. But unlike Amaranta, unlike all of them, Meme still did not reveal the solitary fate of the family </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she seemed entirely in conformity with the world, even when she would shut herself up in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parlor at two in the afternoon to practice the clavichord with an inflexible discipline. It was obvious </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she liked the house, that she spent the whole year dreaming about the excitement of the young </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people her arrival brought around, and that she was not far removed from the festive vocation and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hospitable excesses of her father. The first sign of that calamitous inheritance was revealed on her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">third vacation, when Meme appeared at the house with four nuns and sixty-eight classmates whom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had invited to spend a week with her family on her own Initiative and without any previous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">warning. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; Fernanda lamented. &ldquo;This child is as much of a barbarian as her father!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was necessary to borrow beds and hammocks from the neighbors, to set up nine shifts at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">table, to fix hours for bathing, and to borrow forty stools so that the girls in blue uniforms with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">masculine buttons would not spend the whole day running from one place to another. The visit was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a failure because the noisy schoolgirls would scarcely finish breakfast before they had to start taking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">turns for lunch and then for dinner, and for the whole week they were able to take only one walk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the plantations. At nightfall the nuns were exhausted, unable to move, give another order, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and still the troop of tireless adolescents was in the courtyard singing school songs out of tune. One </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">128 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day they were on the point of trampling Ursula, who made an effort to be useful precisely where she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was most in the way. On another day the nuns got all excited because Colonel Aureliano Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had urinated under the chestnut tree without being concerned that the schoolgirls were in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard. Amaranta was on the point of causing panic because one of the nuns went into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kitchen as she was salting the soup and the only thing that occurred to her to say was to ask what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those handfuls of white powder were. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Arsenic,&rdquo; Amaranta answered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night of their arrival the students carried on in such a way, trying to go to the bathroom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before they went to bed, that at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning the last ones were still going in. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda then bought seventy-two chamberpots but she only managed to change the nocturnal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">problem into a morning one, because from dawn on there was a long line of girls, each with her pot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in her hand, waiting for her turn to wash it. Although some of them suffered fevers and several of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them were infected by mosquito bites, most of them showed an unbreakable resistance as they faced </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the most troublesome difficulties, and even at the time of the greatest heat they would scamper </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the garden. When they finally left, the flowers were destroyed, the furniture broken, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walls covered with drawings and writing, but Fernanda pardoned them for all of the damage because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of her relief at their leaving. She returned the borrowed beds and stools and kept the seventy-two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chamberpots in Melquiades&rsquo; room. The locked room, about which the spiritual life of the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">revolved in former times, was known from that time on as the &ldquo;chamberpot room.&rdquo; For Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia it was the most appropriate name, because while the rest of the family was still </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">amazed by the fact that Melquiades&rsquo; room was immune to dust and destruction, he saw it turned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a dunghill. In any case, it did not seem to bother him who was correct, and if he found out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about the fate of the room it was because Fernanda kept passing by and disturbing his work for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whole afternoon as she put away the chamberpots. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During those days Jose Arcadio Segundo reappeared in the house. He went along the porch </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without greeting anyone and he shut himself up in the workshop to talk to the colonel. In spite of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the fact that she could not see him, Ursula analyzed the clicking of his foreman&rsquo;s boots and was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surprised at the unbridgeable distance that separated him from the family, even from the twin </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brother with whom he had played ingenious games of confusion in childhood and with whom he no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">longer had any traits in common. He was linear, solemn, and had a pensive air and the sadness of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saracen and a mournful glow on his face that was the color of autumn. He was the one who most </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">resembled his mother, Santa Sofia de la Piedad. Ursula reproached herself for the habit of forgetting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about him when she spoke about the family, but when she sensed him in the house again and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">noticed that the colonel let him into the workshop during working hours, she reexamined her old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memories and confirmed the belief that at some moment in childhood he had changed places with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his twin brother, because it was he and not the other one who should have been called Aureliano. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one knew the details of his life. At one time it was discovered that he had no fixed abode, that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he raised fighting cocks at Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s house and that sometimes he would stay there to sleep but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he almost always spent the night in the rooms of the French matrons. He drifted about, with no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ties of affection, with no ambitions, like a wandering star in Ursula&rsquo;s planetary system. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In reality, Jose Arcadio Segundo was not a member of the family, nor would he ever be of any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other since that distant dawn when Colonel Gerineldo Marquez took him to the barracks, not so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he could see an execution, but so that for the rest of his life he would never forget the sad and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">somewhat mocking smile of the man being shot. That was not only his oldest memory, but the only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one he had of his childhood. The other one, that of an old man with an old-fashioned vest and a hat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a brim like a crow&rsquo;s wings who told him marvelous things framed in a dazzling window, he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unable to place in any period. It was an uncertain memory, entirely devoid of lessons or nostalgia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the opposite of the memory of the executed man, which had really set the direction of Iris life and </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">129 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would return to his memory clearer and dearer as he grew older, as if the passage of time were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bringing him closer to it. Ursula tried to use Jose Arcadio Segundo to get Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia. to give up his imprisonment. &ldquo;Get him to go to the movies,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Even if he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doesn&rsquo;t like the picture, as least he&rsquo;ll breathe a little fresh air.&rdquo; But it did not take her long to realize </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he was as insensible to her begging as the colonel would have been, and that they were armored </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the same impermeability of affection. Although she never knew, nor did anyone know, what they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spoke about in their prolonged sessions shut up in the workshop, she understood that they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">probably the only members of the family who seemed drawn together by some affinity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth is that not even Jose Arcadio Segundo would have been able to draw the colonel out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inis confinement. The invasion of schoolgirls had lowered the limits of his patience. With the pretext </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that his wedding bedroom was at the mercy of the moths in spite of the destruction of Remedios&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appetizing dolls, he hung a hammock in the workshop and then he would leave it only to go into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard to take care of his necessities. Ursula was unable to string together even a trivial </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conversation with him. She knew that he did not look at the dishes of food but would put them at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one end of his workbench while he finished a little fish and it did not matter to him if the soup </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">curdled or if the meat got cold. He grew harder and harder ever since Colonel Gerineldo Marquez </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">refused to back him up in a senile war. He locked himself up inside himself and the family finally </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought of him is if he were dead. No other human reaction was seen in him until one October </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eleventh, when he went to the. street door to watch a circus parade. For Colonel Aureliano Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it had been a day just like all those of his last years. At five o&rsquo;clock in the morning the noise of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">toads and crickets outside the wall woke him up. The drizzle had persisted since Saturday and there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was no necessity for him to hear their tiny whispering among the leaves of the garden because he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would have felt the cold in his bones in any case. He was, as always, wrapped in his woolen blanket </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and wearing his crude cotton long drawers, which he still wore for comfort, even though because of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their musty, old-fashioned style he called them his &ldquo;Goth drawers.&rdquo; He put on his tight pants but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not button them up, nor did he put the gold button into his shirt collar as he always did, because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he planned to take a bath. Then he put the blanket over his head like a cowl, brushed his dripping </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mustache with his fingers, and went to urinate in the courtyard. There was still so much time left for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the sun to come out that Jose Arcadio Buendia was still dozing under the shelter of palm fronds that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been rotted by the rain. He did not see him, as he had never seen him, nor did he hear the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">incomprehensible phrase that the ghost of his father addressed to him as he awakened, startled by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the stream of hot urine that splattered his shoes. He put the bath off for later, not because of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cold and the dampness, but because of the oppressive October mist. On his way back to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">workshop he noticed the odor of the wick that Santa Sofia de la Piedad was using to light the stoves, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil so that he could take along his mug without sugar. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Santa Sofia de la Piedad asked him, as on every morning, what day of the week it was, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">answered that it was Tuesday, October eleventh. Watching the glow of the fire as it gilded the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">persistent woman who neither then nor in any instant of her life seemed to exist completely, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suddenly remembered that on one October eleventh in the middle of the war he had awakened with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the brutal certainty that the woman with whom he had slept was dead. She really was and he could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not forget the date because she had asked him an hour before what day it was. In spite of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memory he did not have an awareness this time either of to what degree his omens had abandoned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him and while the coffee was boiling he kept on thinking out of pure curiosity but without the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slightest risk of nostalgia about the woman whose name he had never known and whose face he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not seen because she had stumbled to his hammock in the dark. Nevertheless, in the emptiness of so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many women who came into his life in the same way, he did not remember that she was the one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who in the delirium of that first meeting was on the point of foundering in her own tears and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scarcely an hour before her death had sworn to love him until she died. He did not think about her </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">130 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again or about any of the others after he went into the workshop with the steaming cup, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lighted the lamp in order to count the little gold fishes, which he kept in a tin pail. There were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seventeen of them. Since he had decided not to sell any, he kept on making two fishes a day and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he finished twenty-five he would melt them down and start all over again. He worked all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morning, absorbed, without thinking about anything, without realizing that at ten o&rsquo;clock the rain </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had grown stronger and someone ran past the workshop shouting to close the doors before the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house was flooded, and without thinking even about himself until Ursula came in with his lunch and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">turned out the light. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a rain!&rdquo; Ursula said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;October,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he said it he did not raise his eyes from the first little fish of the day because he was putting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the rubies for the eyes. Only when he finished it and put it with the others in the pail did he begin </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to drink the soup. Then, very slowly, he ate the piece of meat roasted with onions, the white rice, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the slices of fried bananas all on the same plate together. His appetite did not change under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">either the best or the harshest of circumstances. After lunch he felt the drowsiness of inactivity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of a kind of scientific superstition he never worked, or read, or bathed, or made love until </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two hours of digestion had gone by, and it was such a deep-rooted belief that several times he held </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up military operations so as not to submit the troops to the risks of indigestion. So he lay down in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the hammock, removing the wax from his ears with a penknife, and in a few minutes he was asleep. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He dreamed that he was going into an empty house with white walls and that he was upset by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burden of being the first human being to enter it. In the dream he remembered that he had dreamed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the same thing the night before and on many nights over the past years and he knew that the image </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be erased from his memory when he awakened because that recurrent dream had the quality </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of not being remembered except within the dream itself. A moment later, indeed, when the barber </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knocked at the workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Buendfa awoke with the impression that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fallen asleep involuntarily for a few seconds and that he had not had time to dream anything. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not today.&rdquo; he told the barber. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it on Friday.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had a three-day beard speckled with white hairs, but he did not think it necessary to shave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because on Friday he was going to have his hair cut and it could all be done at the same time. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sticky sweat of the unwanted siesta aroused the scars of the sores in his armpits. The sky had cleared </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but the sun had not come out. Colonel Aureliano Buendfa released a sonorous belch which brought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back the acidity of the soup to his palate and which was like a command from his organism to throw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his blanket over his shoulders and go to the toilet. He stayed there longer than was necessary, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crouched over the dense fermentation that was coming out of the wooden box until habit told him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it was time to start work again. During the time he lingered he remembered again that it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday, and that Jose Arcadio Segundo had not come to the workshop because it was payday on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the banana company farms. That recollection, as all of those of the past few years, led him to think </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about the war without his realizing it. He remembered that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had once </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promised to get him a horse with a white star on its face and that he had never spoken about it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again. Then he went on toward scattered episodes but he brought them back without any judgment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because since he could not think about anything else, he had learned to think coldly so that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inescapable memories would not touch any feeling. On his way back to the workshop, seeing that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the air was beginning to dry out, he decided that it was a good time to take a bath, but Amaranta had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">got there ahead of him. So he started on the second little fish of the day. He was putting a hook on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the tail when the sun came out with such strength that the light creaked like a fishing boat. The air, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which had been washed by the three-day drizzle, was filled with flying ants. Then he came to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">realization that he felt like urinating and he had been putting it off until he had finished fixing the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">little fish. He went out into the courtyard at ten minutes after four, when he heard the distant brass </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">131 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">instruments, the beating of the bass drum and the shouting of the children, and for the first time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since his youth he knowingly fell into a trap of nostalgia and relived that prodigious afternoon Of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the gypsies when his father took him to see ice. Santa Sofia de la Piedad dropped what she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doing in the kitchen and ran to the door. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the circus,&rdquo; she shouted. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Aureliano Buendia also went to the street door and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mingled with the bystanders who, were watching the parade. He saw a woman dressed in gold sitting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the head of an elephant. He saw a sad dromedary. He saw a bear dressed like a Dutch girl </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">keeping time to the music with a soup spoon and a pan. He saw the clowns doing cartwheels at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">end of the parade and once more he saw the face of his miserable solitude when everything had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passed by and there was nothing but the bright expanse of the street and the air full of flying ants </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a few onlookers peering into the precipice of uncertainty. Then he went to the chestnut tree, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thinking about the circus, and while he urinated he tried to keep on thinking about the circus, but he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could no longer find the memory. He pulled his head in between his shoulders like a baby chick and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remained motionless with his forehead against the trunk of the chestnut tree. The family did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">find him until the following day at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning when Santa Sofia de la Piedad went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to throw out the garbage in back and her attention was attracted by the descending vultures. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">132 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 14 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">MEME&rsquo;S LAST VACATIONS coincided with the period of mourning for Colonel Aureliano Buendia. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shuttered house was no place for parties. They spoke in whispers, ate in silence, recited the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rosary three times a day, and even clavichord practice during the heat of siesta time had a funereal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">echo. In spite of her secret hostility toward the colonel, it was Fernanda who imposed the rigor of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that mourning, impressed by the solemnity with which the government exalted the memory of its </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dead enemy. Aureliano Segundo, as was his custom came back to sleep in the house during his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">daughter&rsquo;s vacation and Fernanda must have done some, thing to regain her privileges as his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">legitimate wife because the following year Meme found a newborn little sister who against the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wishes of her mother had been baptized with the name Amaranta Ursula. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme had finished her course of study. The diploma that certified her as a concert clavichordist </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was ratified by the virtuosity with which she executed popular melodies of the seventeenth century </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at the gathering organized to celebrate the completion of her studies and with which the period of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mourning came to in end. More than her art, the guests admired her duality. Her frivolous and even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slightly infantile character did not seem up to any serious activity, but when she sat down at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clavichord she became a different girl, one whose unforeseen maturity gave her the air of an adult. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how she had always been. She really did am have any definite vocation, but she had earned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the highest grades by means of inflexible discipline simply in order not to annoy her mother. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could have imposed on her an apprenticeship in any other field and the results would have been the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same. Since she had been very small she had been troubled by Fernanda&rsquo;s strictness, her custom of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deciding in favor of extremes; and she would have been capable of a much more difficult sacrifice </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than the clavichord lessons merely not to run up against her intransigence. During the graduation </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ceremonies she had the impression that the parchment with Gothic letters and illuminated capitals </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was freeing her from a compromise that she had accepted not so much out of obedience as out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convenience, and she thought that from then on not even the insistent Fernanda would worry any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more about an instmment that even the nuns looked upon as a museum fossil. During the first years </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she thought that her calculations were mistaken because after she had put half the town to sleep, not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only in the parlor but also at all charitable functions, school ceremonies, and patriotic celebrations </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that took place in Macondo, her mother still invited to the house every newcomer whom she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought capable of appreciating her daughter&rsquo;s virtues. Only after the death of Amaranta, when the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">family shut itself up again in a period of mourning, was Meme able to lock the clavichord and forget </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the key in some dresser drawer without Fernanda&rsquo;s being annoyed on finding out when and through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whose fault it had been lost. Meme bore up under the exhibitions with the same stoicism that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had dedicated to her apprenticeship. It was the price of her freedom. Fernanda was so pleased with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her docility and so proud of the admiration that her art inspired that she was never against the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being fall of girl friends, her spending the afternoon in the groves, and going to the movies with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo or some muted lady as long as the film was approved by Father Antonio Isabel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the pulpit. During those moments of relaxation Meme&rsquo;s real tastes were revealed. Her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">happiness lay at the other extreme from discipline, in noisy parties, in gossip about lovers, in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prolonged sessions with her girl friends, where they learned to smoke and talked about male </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">business, and where they once got their hands on some cane liquor and ended up naked, measuring </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and comparing the parts of their bodies. Meme would never forget that night when she arrived </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">home chewing licorice lozenges, and without noticing their consternation, sat down at the table </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where Fernanda and Amaranta were eating dinner without saying a word to each other. She had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spent two tremendous hours in the bedroom of a girl friend, weeping with laughter and fear, and </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">133 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beyond an crises she had found the rare feeling of. bravery that she needed in order to run away </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from school and tell her mother in one way or another that she could use the clavichord as an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enema. Sitting at the head of the table, drinking a chicken broth that landed in her stomach like an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">elixir of resurrection, Meme then saw Fernanda and Amaranta wrapped in an accusatory halo of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reality. She had to make a great effort not to throw at them their prissiness, their poverty of spirit </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their delusions of grandeur. From the time of her second vacation she had known that her father </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was living at home only in order to keep up appearances, and knowing Fernanda as she did and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">having arranged later to meet Petra Cotes, she thought that her father was right. She also would have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">preferred being the daughter of the concubine. In the haziness of the alcohol Meme thought with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pleasure about the scandal that would have taken place if she were to express her thoughts at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment, and the intimate satisfaction of her roguishness was so intense that Fernanda noticed it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Meme answered. &ldquo;I was only now discovering how much I loved you both.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta was startled by the obvious burden of hate that the declaration carried. But Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">felt so moved that she thought she would go mad when Meme awoke at midnight with her head </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">splitting with pain and drowning in vomited gall. She gave her a vial of castor oil, put compresses on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her stomach and ice cubes on her head, and she made her stay in bed for five days and follow the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">diet ordered by the new and outlandish French doctor, who after examining her for more than two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hours reached the foggy conclusion that she had an ailment peculiar to women. Having lost her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courage, in a miserable state of demoralization, Meme had no other recourse but to bear up under it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula, completely blind by then but still active and lucid, was the only one who guessed the exact </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">diagnosis. &ldquo;As far as I can see,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the same thing that happens to drunken </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people.&rdquo; But she not only rejected the idea, she reproached herself for the frivolity of her thought. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo felt a twinge of conscience when he saw Meme&rsquo;s state of prostration and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promised himself to take better care of her in the future. That was how the relationship of jolly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">comradeship was born between father and daughter, which freed him for a time from the bitter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitude of his revels and freed her from Fernanda&rsquo;s watchful eye without necessity of provoking the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">domestic crisis that seemed inevitable by then. At that time Aureliano Segundo postponed any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appointments in order to be with Meme, to take her to the movies or the circus, and he spent the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">greater part of his idle time with her. In recent times his annoyance with the absurd obesity that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">prevented him from tying his shoes and his abusive satisfaction with all manner of appetites had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to sour his character. The discovery of his daughter restored his former joviality and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pleasure of being with her was slowly leading him away from dissipation. Meme was entering a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fruitful age. She was not beautiful, as Amaranta had never been, but on the other hand she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pleasant, uncomplicated, and she had the virtue of making a good impression on people from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first moment. She had a modem spirit that wounded the antiquated sobriety and poorly disguised </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">miserly heart of Fernanda, and that, on the other hand, Aureliano Segundo took pleasure in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">developing. It was he who resolved to take her out of the bedroom she had occupied since </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">childhood, where the fearful eyes of the saints still fed her adolescent terrors, and he furnished for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her a room with a royal bed, a large dressing table, and velvet curtains, not realizing that he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">producing a second version of Petra Cotes&rsquo;s room. He was so lavish with Meme that he did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even know how much money he gave her because she herself would take it out of his pockets, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he kept abreast of every kind of new beauty aid that arrived in the commissary of the banana </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">company. Meme&rsquo;s room became filled with pumice-stone cushions to polish her nails with, hair </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">curlers, toothbrushes, drops to make her eyes languid, and so many and such new cosmetics and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">artifacts of beauty that every time Fernanda went into the room she was scandalized by the idea that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her daughter&rsquo;s dressing table must have been the same as those of the French matrons. Nevertheless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda divided her time in those days between little Amaranta Ursula, who was mischievous and </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">134 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sickly, and a touching correspondence with the invisible physicians. So that when she noticed the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complicity between father and daughter the only promise she extracted from Aureliano Segundo was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he would never take Meme to Petra Cotes&rsquo;s house. It was a meaningless demand because the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">concubine was so annoyed with the comradeship between her lover and his daughter that she did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not want anything to do with her. Petra was tormented by an unknown fear, as if instinct were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">telling her that Meme, by just wanting it, could succeed in what Fernanda had been unable to do: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deprive her of a love that by then she considered assured until death. For the first time Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo had to tolerate the harsh expressions and the violent tirades of his concubine, and he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even afraid that his wandering trunks would make the return journey to his wife&rsquo;s house. That did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not happen. No one knew a man better than Petra Cotes knew her lover and she knew that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trunks would remain where they had been sent because if Aureliano Segundo detested anything it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was complicating his life with modifications and changes. So the tmnks stayed where they were and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petra Cotes set about reconquering the husband by sharpening the only weapons that his daughter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could not use on him. It too was an unnecessary effort because Meme had no desire to intervene in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her father&rsquo;s affairs and if she had, it would certainly have been in favor of the concubine. She had no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time to bother anybody. She herself swept her room and made her bed, as the nuns had taught her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the morning she took care of her clothes, sewing on the porch or using Amaranta&rsquo;s old pedal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">machine. While the others were taking their siestas she would practice the clavichord for two hours, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knowing that the daily sacrifice would keep Fernanda calm. For the same reason she continued </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">giving concerts at church fairs and school parties, even though the requests were less and less </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frequent. At nightfall she would fix herself up, put on one of her simple dresses and her stiff high </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shoes, and if she had nothing to do with her father she would go to the homes of her girl friends, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where she would stay until dinnertime. It was rare that Aureliano Segundo would not call for her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then to take her to the movies. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among Meme&rsquo;s friends there were three young American girls who broke through the electrified </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chicken fence barrier and made friends with girls from Macondo. One of them was Patricia Brown. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Grateful for the hospitality of Aureliano Segundo, Mr. Brown opened the doors of his house to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances, which were the only ones where gringos and natives </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mingled. When Fernanda found out about it she forgot about Amaranta Ursula and the invisible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doctors for a moment and became very melodramatic. &ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; she said to Meme, &ldquo;what the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colonel must be thinking in his grave.&rdquo; She sought, of course, the backing of Ursula. But the blind </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">old woman, contrary to what everyone expected, saw nothing reproachable in Meme&rsquo;s going to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dances and making friends with American girls her own age as long as she kept her strict habits and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was not converted to the Protestant religion. Meme sensed the thought of her great-great- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandmother very well and the day after the dances she would get up earlier than usual to go to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mass. Fernanda&rsquo;s opposition lasted until the day when Meme broke down her resistance with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">news that the Americans wanted to hear her play the clavichord. The instmment was taken out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house again and carried to Mr. Brown&rsquo;s, where the young concert artist really did receive very </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sincere applause and the most enthusiastic congratulations. From then on she was invited not only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the dances but also to the Sunday swim parties in the pool and to lunch once a week. Meme </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">learned to swim like a professional, to play tennis, and to eat Virginia ham with slices of pineapple. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among dances, swimming, and tennis she soon found herself getting involved in the English </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">language. Aureliano Segundo was so enthusiastic over the progress of his daughter that from a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">traveling salesman he bought a six-volume English encyclopedia with many color prints which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme read in her spare time. The reading occupied the attention that she had formerly given to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gossip about sweethearts and the experimental retreats that she would go through with her girl </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">friends, not because it was imposed as discipline but because she had lost all interest by then in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">talking about mysteries that were in the public domain. She looked back on the drunken episode as </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">135 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an infantile adventure and it seemed so funny to her that she told Aureliano Segundo about it and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought it was more amusing than she did. &ldquo;If your mother only knew,&rdquo; he told her, doubling up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with laughter, as he always said when he told her something in confidence. He had made her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promise that she would let him know about her first love affair with the same confidence, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme told him that she liked a redheaded American boy who had come to spend his vacation with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his parents. &ldquo;What do you know,&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo said, laughing. &ldquo;If your mother only knew.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Meme also told him that the boy had gone back to his country and had disappeared from sight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The maturity of her judgment ensured peace in the family. Aureliano Segundo then devoted more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time to Petra Cotes, and although his body and soul no longer permitted him the debauches of days </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gone by, he lost no chance to arrange them and to dig out the accordion, which by then had some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">keys held in place by shoelaces. At home, Amaranta was weaving her interminable shroud and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula dragged about in her decrepitude through the depths of the shadows where the only thing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was still visible was the ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendfa under the chestnut tree. Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consolidated her authority. Her monthly letters to her son Jose Arcadio at that time did not carry a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">string of lies and she hid from him only her correspondence with the invisible doctors, who had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">diagnosed a benign tumor in her large intestine and were preparing her for a telepathic operation. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might have been aid that peace and happiness reigned for a long time in the tired mansion of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Buendfas if it had not been for the sudden death of Amaranta, which caused a new uproar. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was an unexpected event. Although she was old and isolated from everyone, she still looked firm </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and upright and with the health of a rock that she had always had. No one knew her thoughts since </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the afternoon on which she had given Colonel Gerineldo Marquez his final rejection and shut </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">herself up to weep. She was not seen to cry during the ascension to heaven of Remedios the Beauty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">or over the extermination of the Aurelianos or the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa, who was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">person she loved most in this world, although she showed it only when they found his body under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the chestnut tree. She helped pick up the body. She dressed him in his soldier&rsquo;s uniform, shaved </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him, combed his hair, and waxed his mustache better than he had ever done in his days of glory. No </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one thought that there was any love in that act because they were accustomed to the familiarity of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta with the rites of death. Fernanda was scandalized that she did not understand the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">relationship of Catholicism with life but only its relationship with death, as if it were not a religion </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but a compendium of funeral conventions. Amaranta was too wrapped up in the eggplant patch of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her memories to understand those subtle apologetics. She had reached old age with all of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nostalgias intact. When she listened to the waltzes of Pietro Crespi she felt the same desire to weep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she had had in adolescence, as if time and harsh lessons had meant nothing. The rolls of music </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she herself had thrown into the trash with the pretext that they had rotted from dampness kept </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spinning and playing in her memory. She had tried to sink them into the swampy passion that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">allowed herself with her nephew Aureliano Jose and she tried to take refuge in the calm and virile </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">protection of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, but she had not been able to overcome them, not even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the most desperate act of her old age when she would bathe the small Jose Arcadio three years </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before he was sent to the seminary and caress him not as a grandmother would have done with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandchild, but as a woman would have done with a man, as it was said that the French matrons did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and as she had wanted to do with Pietro Crespi at the age of twelve, fourteen, when she saw him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his dancing tights and with the magic wand with which he kept time to the metronome. At times It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pained her to have let that outpouring of misery follow its course, and at times it made her so angry </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she would prick her fingers with the needles, but what pained her most and enraged her most </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and made her most bitter was the fragrant and wormy guava grove of love that was dragging her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">toward death. Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendia thought about his war, unable to avoid it, so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta thought about Rebeca. But while her brother had managed to sterilize his memories, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had only managed to make hers more scalding. The only thing that she asked of God for many years </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">136 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was that he would not visit on her the punishment of dying before Rebeca. Every time she passed by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her house and noted the progress of destruction she took comfort in the idea that God was listening </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to her. One afternoon, when she was sewing on the porch, she was assailed by the certainty that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be sitting in that place, in the same position, and under the same light when they brought her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the news of Rebeca&rsquo;s death. She sat down to wait for it, as one waits for a letter, and the fact was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that at one time she would pull off buttons to sew them on again so that inactivity would not make </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the wait longer and more anxious. No one in the house realized that at that time Amaranta was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sewing a fine shroud for Rebeca. Later on, when Aureliano Triste told how he had seen her changed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into an apparition with leathery skin and a few golden threads on her skull, Amaranta was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surprised because the specter described was exactly what she had been imagining for some time. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had decided to restore Rebeca&rsquo;s corpse, to disguise with paraffin the damage to her face and make a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wig for her from the hair of the saints. She would manufacture a beautiful corpse, with the linen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shroud and a plush-lined coffin with purple trim, and she would put it at the disposition of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worms with splendid funeral ceremonies. She worked out the plan with such hatred that it made her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tremble to think about the scheme, which she would have carried out in exactly the same way if it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been done out of love, but she would not allow herself to become upset by the confusion and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went on perfecting the details so minutely that she came to be more than a specialist and was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">virtuoso in the rites of death. The only thing that she did not keep In mind in her fearsome plan was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that in spite of her pleas to God she might die before Rebeca. That was, in fact, what happened. At </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the final moment, however, Amaranta did not feel frustrated, but on the contrary, free of all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bitterness because death had awarded her the privilege of announcing itself several years ahead of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time. She saw it on one burning afternoon sewing with her on the porch a short time after Meme </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had left for school. She saw it because it was a woman dressed in blue with long hair, with a sort of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">antiquated look, and with a certain resemblance to Pilar Ternera during the time when she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">helped with the chores in the kitchen. Fernanda was present several times and did not see her, in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spite of the fact that she was so real, so human, and on one occasion asked of Amaranta the favor of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">threading a needle. Death did not tell her when she was going to die or whether her hour was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">assigned before that of Rebeca, but ordered her to begin sewing her own shroud on the next sixth of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April. She was authorized to make it as complicated and as fine as she wanted, but just as honestly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">executed as Rebeca&rsquo;s, and she was told that she would die without pain, fear, or bitterness at dusk on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the day that she finished it. Trying to waste the most time possible, Amaranta ordered some rough </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flax and spun the thread herself. She did it so carefully that the work alone took four years. Then she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">started the sewing. As she got closer to the unavoidable end she began to understand that only a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">miracle would allow her to prolong the work past Rebeca&rsquo;s death, but the very concentration gave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her the calmness that she needed to accept the idea of frustration. It was then that she understood </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the vicious circle of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa&rsquo;s little gold fishes. The world was reduced to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surface of her skin and her inner self was safe from all bitterness. It pained her not to have had that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">revelation many years before when it had still been possible to purify memories and reconstmct the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">universe under a new light and evoke without trembling Pietro Crespi&rsquo;s smell of lavender at dusk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and rescue Rebeca from her slough of misery, not out of hatred or out of love but because of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">measureless understanding of solitude. The hatred that she noticed one night in Memes words did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not upset her because it was directed at her, but she felt the repetition of another adolescence that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seemed as clean as hers must have seemed and that, however, was already tainted with rancor. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by then her acceptance of her fate was so deep that she was not even upset by the certainty that all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">possibilities of rectification were closed to her. Her only objective was to finish the shroud. Instead </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of slowing it down with useless detail as she had done in the beginning, she speeded up the work. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One week before she calculated that she would take the last stitch on the night of February 4, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without revealing the motives, she suggested to Meme that she move up a clavichord concert that </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">137 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had arranged for the day after, but the girl paid no attention to her. Amaranta then looked for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">way to delay for forty-eight hours, and she even thought that death was giving her her way because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the night of February fourth a storm caused a breakdown at the power plant. But on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">following day, at eight in the morning, she took the last stitch in the most beautiful piece of work </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that any woman had ever finished, and she announced without the least bit of dramatics that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was going to die at dusk. She not only told the family but the whole town, because Amaranta had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conceived of the idea that she could make up for a life of meanness with one last favor to the world, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she thought that no one was in a better position to take letters to the dead. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The news that Amaranta Buendia was sailing at dusk carrying the mail of death spread </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">throughout Macondo before noon, and at three in the afternoon there was a whole carton full of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letters in the parlor. Those who did not want to write gave Amaranta verbal messages, which she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrote down in a notebook with the name and date of death of the recipient. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she told </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the senders. &ldquo;The first thing I&rsquo;ll do when I get there is to ask for him and give him your message.&rdquo; It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was farcical. Amaranta did not show any upset or the slightest sign of grief, and she even looked a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bit rejuvenated by a duty accomplished. She was as straight and as thin as ever. If it had not been for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her hardened cheekbones and a few missing teeth, she would have looked much younger than she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">really was. She herself arranged for them to put the letters in a box sealed with pitch and told them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to place it in her grave in a way best to protect it from the dampness. In the morning she had a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carpenter called who took her measurements for the coffin as she stood in the parlor, as if it were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for a new dress. She showed such vigor in her last hours that Fernanda thought she was making fun </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of everyone. Ursula, with the experience that Buendias died without any illness, did not doubt at all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Amaranta had received an omen of death, but in any case she was tormented by the fear that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the business of the letters and the anxiety of the senders for them to arrive quickly they would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bury her alive in their confusion. So she set about clearing out the house, arguing with the intmders </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as she shouted at them, and by four in the afternoon she was successful. At that time Amaranta had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finished dividing her things among the poor and had left on the severe coffin of unfinished boards </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only the change of clothing and the simple cloth slippers that she would wear in death. She did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">neglect that precaution because she remembered that when Colonel Aureliano Buendia died they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had to buy a pair of new shoes for him because all he had left were the bedroom slippers that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wore in the workshop. A little before five Aureliano Segundo came to fetch Meme for the concert </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and was surprised that the house was prepared for the funeral, if anyone seemed alive at the moment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it was the serene Amaranta, who had even had enough time to cut her corns. Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Meme took leave of her with mocking farewells and promised her that on the following </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday they would have a big resurrection party. Drawn by the public talk that Amaranta Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was receiving letters for the dead. Father Antonio Isabel arrived at five o&rsquo;clock for the last rites and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he had to wait for more than fifteen minutes for the recipient to come out of her bath. When he saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her appear in a madapollam nightshirt and with her hair loose over her shoulders, the decrepit parish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">priest thought that it was a trick and sent the altar boy away. He thought however, that he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take advantage of the occasion to have Amaranta confess after twenty years of reticence. Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">answered simply that she did not need spiritual help of any kind because her conscience was clean. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda was scandalized. Without caring that people could hear her she asked herself aloud what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">horrible sin Amaranta had committed to make her prefer an impious death to the shame of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confession. Thereupon Amaranta lay down and made Ursula give public testimony as to her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">virginity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let no one have any illusions,&rdquo; she shouted so that Fernanda would hear her. &ldquo;Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia is leaving this world just as she came into it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did not get up again. Lying on cushions, as if she really were ill, she braided her long hair and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rolled it about her ears as death had told her it should be on her bier. Then she asked Ursula for a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">138 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mirror and for the first time in more than forty years she saw her face, devastated by age and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">martyrdom, and she was surprised at how much she resembled the mental image that she had of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">herself. Ursula understood by the silence in the bedroom that it had begun to grow dark. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say good-bye to Fernanda,&rdquo; she begged her. One minute of reconciliation is worth more than a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whole life of friendship.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use now,&rdquo; Amaranta replied. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme could not help thinking about her when they turned on the lights on the improvised stage </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she began the second part of the program. In the middle of the piece someone whispered the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">news in her ear and the session stopped. When he arrived home, Aureliano Segundo had to push his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">way through the crowd to see the corpse of the aged virgin, ugly and discolored, with the black </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bandage on her hand and wrapped in the magnificent shroud. She was laid out in the parlor beside </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the box of letters. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula did not get up again after the nine nights of mourning for Amaranta, Santa Sofia de la </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Piedad took care of her. She took her meals to her bedroom and annatto water for her to wash in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and she kept her up to date on everything that happened in Macondo. Aureliano Segundo visited her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frequently and he brought her clothing which she would place beside the bed along with the things </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">most indispensable for daily life, so that in a short time she had built up a world within reach of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hand. She managed to arouse a great love in little Amaranta Ursula, who was just like her, and whom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she taught how to read. Her lucidity, the ability to be sufficient un herself made one think that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was naturally conquered by the weight of her hundred years, but even though it was obvious that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was having trouble seeing, no one suspected that she was totally blind. She had so much time at her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disposal then and so much interior silence to watch over the life of the house that she was the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to notice Meme&rsquo;s silent tribulation. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; she told her. &ldquo;Now that were alone, confess to this poor old woman what&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bothering you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme avoided the conversation with a short laugh. Ursula did not insist, but she ended up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">confirming her suspicions when Meme did not come back to visit her. She knew that she was getting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up earlier than usual, that she did not have a moment&rsquo;s rest as she waited for the time for her to go </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out, that she spent whole nights walking back and forth in the adjoining bedroom, and that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fluttering of a butterfly would bother her. On one occasion she said that she was going to see Aureli&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ano Segundo and Ursula was surprised that Fernanda&rsquo;s imagination was so limited when her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband came to the house looking for his daughter. It was too obvious that Meme was involved in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secret matters, in pressing matters, in repressed anxieties long before the night that Fernanda upset </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house because she caught her kissing a man in the movies. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme was so wrapped up in herself at that time that she accused Ursula of having told on her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, she told on herself. For a long time she had been leaving a trail that would have awakened </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the most drowsy person and it took Fernanda so long to discover it because she too was befogged, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by her relationship with the invisible doctors. Even so she finally noticed the deep silences, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sudden outbursts, the changes in mood, and the contradictions of her daughter. She set about on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disguised but implacable vigilance. She let her go out with her girl friends as always, she helped her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">get dressed for the Saturday parties, and she never asked an embarrassing question that might arouse </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her. She already had a great deal of proof that Meme was doing different things from what she said, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and yet she would give no indication of her suspicions, hoping for the right moment. One night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme said that she was going to the movies with her father. A short time later Fernanda heard the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fireworks of the debauch and the unmistakable accordion of Aureliano Segundo from the direction </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Petra Cotes&rsquo;s place. Then she got dressed, went to the movie theater, and in the darkness of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seats she recognized her daughter. The upsetting feeling of certainty stopped her from seeing the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man she was kissing, but she managed to hear his tremulous voice in the midst of the deafening </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">139 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shouts and laughter of the audience. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, love,&rdquo; she heard him say, and she took Meme out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the place without saying a word to her, put her through the shame of parading her along the noisy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Street of the Turks, and locked her up in her bedroom. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the following day at six in the afternoon, Fernanda recognized the voice of the man who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came to call on her. He was young, sallow, with dark and melancholy eyes which would not have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">startled her so much if she had known the gypsies, and a dreamy air that to any woman with a heart </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">less rigid would have been enough to make her understand her daughter&rsquo;s motives. He was wearing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a shabby linen suit with shoes that showed the desperate defense of superimposed patches of white </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">zinc, and in his hand he was carrying a straw hat he had bought the Saturday before. In all of his life </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he could never have been as frightened as at that moment, but he had a dignity and presence that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spared him from humiliation and a genuine elegance that was defeated only by tarnished hands and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nails that had been shattered by rough work. Fernanda, however, needed only one look to guess his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">status of mechanic. She saw that he was wearing his one Sunday suit and that underneath his shirt he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bore the rash of the banana company. She would not let him speak. She would not even let him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come through the door, which a moment later she had to close because the house was filled with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">yellow butterflies. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no reason to come calling on any decent person.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His name was Mauricio Babilonia. He had been born and raised in Macondo, and he was an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">apprentice mechanic in the banana company garage. Meme had met him by chance one afternoon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when she went with Patricia Brown to get a car to take a drive through the groves. Since the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chauffeur was sick they assigned him to take them and Meme was finally able to satisfy her desire to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sit next to the driver and see what he did. Unlike the regular chauffeur, Mauricio Babilonia gave her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a practical lesson. That was during the time that Meme was beginning to frequent Mr. Brown&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house and it was still considered improper for a lady to drive a car. So she was satisfied with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">technical information and she did not see Mauricio Babilonia again for several months. Later on she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would remember that during the drive her attention had been called to his masculine beauty, except </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for the coarseness of his hands, but that afterward she had mentioned to Patricia Brown that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been bothered by his rather proud sense of security. The first Saturday that she went to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">movies with her father she saw Mauricio Babilonia again, with his linen suit, sitting a few seats away </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from them, and she noticed that he was not paying much attention to the film in order to turn </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">around and look at her. Meme was bothered by the vulgarity of that. Afterward Mauricio Babilonia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">came over to say hello to Aureliano Segundo and only then did Meme find out that they knew each </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other because he had worked in Aureliano Triste&rsquo;s early power plant and he treated her father with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the air of an employee. That fact relieved the dislike that his pride had caused in her. They had never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been alone together nor had they spoken except in way of greeting, the night when she dreamed that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was saving her from a shipwreck and she did not feel gratitude but rage. It was as if she had given </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him the opportunity he was waiting for, since Meme yearned for just the opposite, not only with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mauricio Babilonia but with any other man who was interested in her. Therefore she was so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">indignant after the dream that instead of hating him, she felt an irresistible urge to see him. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anxiety became more intense during the course of the week and on Saturday it was so pressing that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had to make a great effort for Mauricio Babilonia not to notice that when he greeted her in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">movies her heart was in her mouth. Dazed by a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, she gave him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her hand for the first time and only then did Mauricio Babilonia let himself shake hers. Meme </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">managed to repent her impulse in a fraction of a second but the repentance changed immediately </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a cruel satisfaction on seeing that his hand too was sweaty and cold. That night she realized that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she would not have a moment of rest until she showed Mauricio Babilonia the uselessness of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">aspiration and she spent the week turning that anxiety about in her mind. She resorted to all kinds of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">useless tricks so that Patricia Brown would go get the car with her. Finally she made use of the </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">140 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">American redhead who was spending his vacation in Macondo at that time and with the pretext of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">learning about new models of cars she had him take her to the garage. From the moment she saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him Meme let herself be deceived by herself and believed that what was really going on was that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could not bear the desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, and she was made indignant by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">certainty that he understood that when he saw her arrive. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I came to see the new models,&rdquo; Meme said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine excuse,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme realized that he was burning in the heat of his pride, and she desperately looked for a way </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to humiliate him. But he would not give her any time. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get upset,&rdquo; he said to her in a low </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time that a woman has gone crazy over a man.&rdquo; She felt so defeated that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">left the garage without seeing the new models and she spent the night turning over in bed and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weeping with indignation. The American redhead, who was really beginning to interest her, looked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">like a baby in diapers. It was then that she realized that the yellow butterflies preceded the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appearances of Mauricio Babilonia. She had seen them before, especially over the garage, and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had thought that they were drawn by the smell of paint. Once she had seen them fluttering about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her head before she went into the movies. But when Mauricio Babilonia began to pursue her like a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ghost that only she could identify in the crowd, she understood that the butterflies had something to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">do with him. Mauricio Babilonia was always in the audience at the concerts, at the movies, at high </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mass, and she did not have to see him to know that he was there, because the butterflies were always </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there. Once Aureliano Segundo became so impatient with the suffocating fluttering that she felt the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impulse to confide her secret to him as she had promised, but instinct told her that he would laugh </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as usual and say: &ldquo;What would your mother say if she found out?&rdquo; One morning, while she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pruning the roses, Fernanda let out a cry of fright and had Meme taken away from the spot where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she was, which was the same place in the garden where Remedios the Beauty had gone up to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heaven. She had thought for an instant that the miracle was going to be repeated with her daughter, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because she had been bothered by a sudden flapping of wings. It was the butterflies. Meme saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them as if they had suddenly been born out of the light and her heart gave a turn. At that moment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mauricio Babilonia came in with a package that according to what he said, was a present from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Patricia Brown. Meme swallowed her blush, absorbed her tribulation, and even managed a natural </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">smile as she asked him the favor of leaving it on the railing because her hands were dirty from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">garden. The only tiling that Fernanda noted in the man whom a few months later she was to expel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the house without remembering where she had seen him was the bilious texture of his skin. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very strange man,&rdquo; Fernanda said. &ldquo;You can see in his face that he&rsquo;s going to die.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme thought that her mother had been impressed by the butterflies When they finished </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pruning the row bushes she washed her hands and took the package to her bedroom to open it. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a kind of Chinese toy, made up of five concentric boxes, and in the last one there was a card </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laboriously inscribed by someone who could barely write: We&rsquo;ll get together Saturday at the movies. Meme </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">felt with an aftershock that the box had been on the railing for a long time within reach of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda&rsquo;s curiosity, and although she was flattered by the audacity and ingenuity of Mauricio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Babilonia, she was moved by his Innocence in expecting that she would keep the date. Meme knew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at that time that Aureliano Segundo had an appointment on Saturday night. Nevertheless, the fire of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anxiety burned her so much during the course of the week that on Saturday she convinced her father </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to leave her alone in the theater and come back for her after the show. A nocturnal butterfly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fluttered about her head while the lights were on. And then it happened. When the lights went out, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mauricio Babilonia sat down beside her. Meme felt herself splashing in a bog of hesitation from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which she could only be rescued, as had occurred in her dreams, by that man smelling of grease </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whom she could barely see in the shadows. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You never would have seen me again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">141 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme felt the weight of his hand on her knee and she knew that they were both arriving at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other side of abandonment at that instant. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What shocks me about you,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;is that you always say exactly what you </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shouldn&rsquo;t be saying.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She lost her mind over him. She could not sleep and she lost her appetite and sank so deeply into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitude that even her father became an annoyance. She worked out an intricate web of false dates to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">throw Fernanda off the track, lost sight of her girl friends, leaped over conventions to be with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mauricio Babilonia at any time and at any place. At first his crudeness bothered her. The first time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that they were alone on the deserted fields behind the garage he pulled her mercilessly into an animal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">state that left her exhausted. It took her time to realize that it was also a form of tenderness and it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was then that she lost her calm and lived only for him, upset by the desire to sink into his stupefying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">odor of grease washed off by lye. A short time before the death of Amaranta she suddenly stumbled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into in open space of lucidity within the madness and she trembled before the uncertainty of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">future. Then she heard about a woman who made predictions from cards and went to see her in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secret. It was Pilar Ternera. As soon as Pilar saw her come in she was aware of Meme&rsquo;s hidden </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">motives. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she told her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need cards to tell the future of a Buendia,&rdquo; Meme did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">know and never would that the centenarian witch was her great-grandmother. Nor would she have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">believed it after the aggressive realism with which she revealed to her that the anxiety of falling in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">love could not find repose except in bed. It was the same point of view as Mauricio Babilonia&rsquo;s, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme resisted believing it because underneath it all she imagined that it had been inspired by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">poor judgment of a mechanic. She thought then that love on one side was defeating love on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other, because it was characteristic of men to deny hunger once their appetites were satisfied. Pilar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ternera not only cleared up that mistake, she also offered the old canopied bed where she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conceived Arcadio, Meme&rsquo;s grandfather, and where afterward she conceived Aureliano Jose. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">also taught her how to avoid an unwanted conception by means of the evaporation of mustard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plasters and gave her recipes for potions that in cases of trouble could expel &ldquo;even the remorse of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conscience.&rdquo; That interview instilled In Meme the same feeling of bravery that she had felt on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dmnken evening. Amaranta&rsquo;s death, however, obliged her to postpone the decision. While the nine </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nights lasted she did not once leave the side of Mauricio Babilonia, who mingled with the crowd that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invaded the house. Then came the long period of mourning and the obligatory withdrawal and they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">separated for a time. Those were days of such inner agitation, such irrepressible anxiety, and so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many repressed urges that on the first evening that Meme was able to get out she went straight to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s. She surrendered to Mauricio Babilonia, without resistance, without shyness, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">formalities, and with a vocation that was so fluid and an intuition that was so wise that a more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suspicious man than hers would have confused them with obvious experience. They made love </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twice a week for more than three months, protected by the innocent complicity of Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo, who believed without suspicion in his daughter&rsquo;s alibis simply in order to set her free from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her mother&rsquo;s rigidity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the night that Fernanda surprised them in the movies Aureliano Segundo felt weighted down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the burden of his conscience and he visited Meme in the bedroom where Fernanda kept her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">locked up, trusting that she would reveal to him the confidences that she owed him. But Meme </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">denied everything. She was so sure of herself, so anchored in her solitude that Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had the impression that no link existed between them anymore, that the comradeship and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complicity were nothing but an illusion of the past. He thought of speaking to Mauricio Babilonia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thinking that his authority as his former boss would make him desist from his plans, but Petra Cotes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced him that it was a woman&rsquo;s business, so he was left floating in a limbo of indecision, barely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sustained by the hope that the confinement would put an end to his daughter&rsquo;s troubles. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">142 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme showed no signs of affliction. On the contrary, from the next room Ursula perceived the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">peaceful rhythm of her sleep, the serenity of her tasks, the order of her meals, and the good health </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of her digestion. The only thing that intrigued Ursula after almost two months of punishment was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Meme did not take a bath in the morning like everyone else, but at seven in the evening. Once </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she thought of warning her about the scorpions, but Meme was so distant, convinced that she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">given her away, that she preferred not to disturb her with the impertinences, of a great-great- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandmother. The yellow butterflies would invade the house at dusk. Every night on her way back </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from her bath Meme would find a desperate Fernanda killing butterflies with an insecticide bomb. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is terrible,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;All my life they told me that butterflies at night bring bad luck.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night while Meme was in the bathroom, Fernanda went into her bedroom by chance and there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were so many butterflies that she could scarcely breathe. She grabbed for the nearest piece of cloth </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to shoo them away and her heart froze with terror as she connected her daughter&rsquo;s evening baths </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the mustard plasters that rolled onto the floor. She did not wait for an opportune moment as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had the first time. On the following day she invited the new mayor to lunch. Like her, he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come down from the highlands, and she asked him to station a guard in the backyard because she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had the impression that hens were being stolen. That night the guard brought down Mauricio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Babilonia as he was lifting up the tiles to get into the bathroom where Meme was waiting for him, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">naked and trembling with love among the scorpions and butterflies as she had done almost every </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night for the past few months. A bullet lodged in his spinal column reduced him to his bed for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rest of his life. Fie died of old age in solitude, without a moan, without a protest, without a single </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment of betrayal, tormented by memories and by the yellow butterflies, who did not give him a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment&rsquo;s peace, and ostracized as a chicken thief. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">143 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 15 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE EVENTS that would deal Macondo its fatal blow were just showing themselves when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought Meme Buendia&rsquo;s son home. The public situation was so uncertain then that no one had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sufficient spirit to become involved with private scandals, so that Fernanda was able to count on an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">atmosphere that enabled her to keep the child hidden as if he had never existed. She had to take him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in because the circumstances under which they brought him made rejection impossible. She had to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courage to go through with her inner determination to drown him in the bathroom cistern. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">locked him up in Colonel Aureliano Buendia&rsquo;s old workshop. She succeeded in convincing Santa </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sofia de la Piedad that she had found him floating in a basket. Ursula would die without ever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knowing his origin. Little Amaranta Ursula, who went into the workshop once when Fernanda was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feeding the child, also believed the version of the floating basket. Aureliano Segundo, having broken </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finally with his wife because of the irrational way in which she handled Meme&rsquo;s tragedy, did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">know of the existence of his grandson until three years after they brought him home, when the child </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">escaped from captivity through an oversight on Fernanda&rsquo;s part and appeared on the porch for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fraction of a second, naked, with matted hair, and with an impressive sex organ that was like a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">turkey&rsquo;s wattles, as if he were not a human child but the encyclopedia definition of a cannibal. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda had not counted on that nasty trick of her incorrigible fate. The child was like the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">return of a shame that she had thought exiled by her from the house forever. As soon as they carried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off Mauricio Babilonia with his shattered spinal column, Fernanda had worked out the most minute </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">details of a plan destined to wipe out all traces of the burden. Without consulting her husband, she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">packed her bags, put the three changes of clothing that her daughter would need into a small </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suitcase, and went to get her in her bedroom a half hour before the train arrived. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Renata,&rdquo; she told her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gave no explanation. Meme, for her part, did not expect or want any. She not only did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">know where they were going, but it would have been the same to her if they had been taking her to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the slaughterhouse. She had not spoken again nor would she do so for the rest of her life from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time that she heard the shot in the backyard and the simultaneous cry of pain from Mauricio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Babilonia. When her mother ordered her out of the bedroom she did not comb her hair or wash her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">face and she got into the train as if she were walking in her sleep, not even noticing the yellow </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">butterflies that were still accompanying her. Fernanda never found out nor did she take the trouble </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to, whether that stony silence was a determination of her will or whether she had become mute </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because of the impact of the tragedy. Meme barely took notice of the journey through the formerly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enchanted region. She did not see the shady, endless banana groves on both sides of the tracks. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not see the white houses of the gringos or their gardens, dried out by dust and heat, or the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">women in shorts and blue-striped shirts playing cards on the terraces. She did not see the oxcarts on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the dusty roads loaded down with bunches of bananas. She did not see the girls diving into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">transparent rivers like tarpons, leaving the passengers on the train with the bitterness of their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">splendid breasts, or the miserable huts of the workers all huddled together where Mauricio Babilo- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nia&rsquo;s yellow butterflies fluttered about and in the doorways of which there were green and squalid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children sitting on their pots, and pregnant women who shouted insults at the train. That fleeting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vision, which had been a celebration for her when she came home from school, passed through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme&rsquo;s heart without a quiver. She did not look out of the window, not even when the burning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dampness of the groves ended and the train went through a poppy-laden plain where the carbonized </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">144 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">skeleton of the Spanish galleon still sat and then came out into the dear air alongside the frothy, dirty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sea where almost a century before Jose Arcadio Buendia&rsquo;s illusions had met defeat. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when they had come to the last station in the swamp, she got </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out of the train because Fernanda made her. They got into a small carriage that looked like an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enormous bat, drawn by an asthmatic horse, and they went through the desolate city in the endless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">streets of which, split by saltiness, there was the sound of a piano lesson just like the one that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda heard during the siestas of her adolescence. They went on board a riverboat, the wooden </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wheel of which had a sound of conflagration, and whose msted metal plates reverberated like the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mouth of an oven. Meme shut herself up in her cabin. Twice a day Fernanda left a plate of food by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her bed and twice a day she took it away intact, not because Meme had resolved to die of hunger, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but because even the smell of food was repugnant to her and her stomach rejected even water. Not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even she herself knew that her fertility had outwitted the mustard vapors, just as Fernanda did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">know until almost a year later, when they brought the child. In the suffocating cabin, maddened by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the vibration of the metal plates and the unbearable stench of the mud stirred up by the paddle </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wheel, Meme lost track of the days. Much time had passed when she saw the last yellow butterfly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">destroyed in the blades of the fan and she admitted as an irremediable tmth that Mauricio Babilonia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had died. She did not let herself be defeated by resignation, however. She kept on thinking about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him during the arduous muleback crossing of the hallucinating plateau where Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had become lost when he was looking for the most beautiful woman who had ever appeared on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">face of the earth, and when they went over the mountains along Indian trails and entered the gloomy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">city in whose stone alleys the funereal bronze bells of thirty-two churches tolled. That night they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slept in the abandoned colonial mansion on boards that Fernanda laid on the floor of a room </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invaded by weeds, wrapped in the shreds of curtains that they pulled off the windows and that fell to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pieces with every turn of the body. Meme knew where they were because in the flight of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insomnia she saw pass by the gentleman dressed in black whom they delivered to the house inside a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lead box on one distant Christmas Eve. On the following day, after mass, Fernanda took her to a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">somber building that Meme recognized immediately from her mother&rsquo;s stories of the convent where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had raised her to be a queen, and then she understood that they had come to the end of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">journey. While Fernanda was speaking to someone in the office next door, Meme remained in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parlor checkered with large oil paintings of colonial archbishops, still wearing an etamine dress with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">small black flowers and stiff high shoes which were swollen by the cold of the uplands. She was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">standing in the center of the parlor thinking about Mauricio Babilonia under the yellow stream of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">light from the stained glass windows when a very beautiful novice came out of the office carrying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her suitcase with the three changes of clothing. As she passed Meme she took her hand without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stopping. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come, Renata,&rdquo; she said to her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme took her hand and let herself be led. The last time that Fernanda saw her, trying to keep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up with the novice, the iron grating of the cloister had just closed behind her. She was still thinking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about Mauricio Babilonia, his smell of grease, and his halo of butterflies, and she would keep on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thinking about him for all the days of her life until the remote autumn morning when she died of old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">age, with her name changed and her head shaved and without ever having spoken a word, in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gloomy hospital in Cracow. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by armed police. During the trip she noticed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the tension of the passengers, the military preparations in the towns along the line, and an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">atmosphere rarified by the certainty that something serious was going to happen, but she had no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">information until she reached Macondo and they told her that Jose Arcadio Segundo was inciting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the workers of the banana company to strike. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we need,&rdquo; Fernanda said to herself. &ldquo;An </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anarchist in the family.&rdquo; The strike broke out two weeks later and it did not have the dramatic </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">145 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consequences that had been feared. The workers demanded that they not be obliged to cut and load </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bananas on Sundays, and the position seemed so just that even Father Antonio Isabel interceded in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">its favor because he found it in accordance with the laws of God. That victory, along with other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">actions that were initiated during the following months, drew the colorless Jose Arcadio Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out of his anonymity, for people had been accustomed to say that he was only good for filling up the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">town with French whores. With the same impulsive decision with which he had auctioned off his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fighting cocks in order to organize a harebrained boat business, he gave up his position as foreman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the banana company and took the side of the workers. Quite soon he was pointed out as the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">agent of an international conspiracy against public order. One night, during the course of a week </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">darkened by somber mmors, he miraculously escaped four revolver shots taken at him by an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unknown party as he was leaving a secret meeting. The atmosphere of the following months was so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tense that even Ursula perceived it in her dark corner, and she had the impression that once more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she was living through the dangerous times when her son Aureliano carried the homeopathic pills of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">subversion in his pocket. She tried to speak to Jose Arcadio Segundo, to let him know about that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">precedent, but Aureliano Segundo told her that since the night of the attempt on his life no one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew his whereabouts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just like Aureliano,&rdquo; Ursula exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if the world were repeating itself.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda, was immune to the uncertainty of those days. She had no contact with the outside </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">world since the violent altercation she had had with her husband over her having decided Memes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fate without his consent. Aureliano Segundo was prepared to rescue his daughter with the help of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the police if necessary, but Fernanda showed him some papers that were proof that she had entered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the convent of her own free will. Meme had indeed signed once she was already behind the iron </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grating and she did it with the same indifference with which she had allowed herself to be led away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Underneath it all, Aureliano Segundo did not believe in the legitimacy of the proof. Just as he never </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">believed that Mauricio Babilonia had gone into the yard to steal chickens, but both expedients </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">served to ease his conscience, and thus he could go back without remorse under the shadow of Petra </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cotes, where he revived his noisy revelry and unlimited gourmandizing. Foreign to the restlessness </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the town, deaf to Ursula&rsquo;s quiet predictions. Fernanda gave the last tarn to the screw of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">preconceived plan. She wrote a long letter to her son Jose Arcadio, who was then about to take his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first orders, and in it she told him that his sister Renata had expired in the peace of the Lord and as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consequence of the black vomit. Then she put Amaranta Ursula under the care of Santa Sofia de la </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Piedad and dedicated herself to organizing her correspondence with the invisible doctors, which had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been upset by Meme&rsquo;s trouble. The first thing that she did was to set a definite date for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">postponed telepathic operation. But the invisible doctors answered her that it was not wise so long </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as the state of social agitation continued in Macondo. She was so urgent and so poorly Informed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she explained to them In another letter that there was no such state of agitation and that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything was the result of the lunacy of a brother-in-law of hers who was fiddling around at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time in that labor union nonsense just as he had been involved with cockfighting and riverboats </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before. They were still not in agreement on the hot Wednesday when an aged nun knocked at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">door bearing a small basket on her arm. When she opened the door Santa Sofia de la Piedad thought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it was a gift and tried to take the small basket that was covered with a lovely lace wrap. But the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nun stopped her because she had instmctions to give it personally and with the strictest secrecy to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dona Fernanda del Carpio de Buendia. It was Meme&rsquo;s son. Fernanda&rsquo;s former spiritual director </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">explained to her in a letter that he had been born two months before and that they had taken the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">privilege of baptizing him Aureliano, for his grandfather, because his mother would not open her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lips to tell them her wishes. Fernanda rose up inside against that trick of fate, but she had sufficient </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strength to hide it in front of the nun. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell them that we found him floating in the basket,&rdquo; she said smiling. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">146 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one will believe it,&rdquo; the nun said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they believe it in the Bible,&rdquo; Fernanda replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they shouldn&rsquo;t believe it from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nun lunched at the house while she waited for the train back, and in accordance with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discretion they asked of her, she did not mention the child again, but Fernanda viewed her as an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">undesirable witness of her shame and lamented the fact that they had abandoned the medieval </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">custom of hanging a messenger who bore bad news. It was then that she decided to drown the child </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the cistern as soon as the nun left, but her heart was not strong enough and she preferred to wait </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">patiendy until the infinite goodness of God would free her from the annoyance. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The new Aureliano was a year old when the tension of the people broke with no forewarning. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo and other union leaders who had remained underground until then suddenly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appeared one weekend and organized demonstrations in towns throughout the banana region. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">police merely maintained public order. But on Monday night the leaders were taken from their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">homes and sent to jail in the capital of the province with two-pound irons on their legs. Taken </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">among them were Jose Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilan, a colonel in the Mexican revolution, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exiled in Macondo, who said that he had been witness to the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were set free, however, within three months because of the fact that the government and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">banana company could not reach an agreement as to who should feed them in jail. The protests of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the workers this time were based on the lack of sanitary facilities in their living quarters, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nonexistence of medical services, and terrible working conditions. They stated, furthermore, that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they were not being paid in real money but in scrip, which was good only to buy Virginia ham in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">company commissaries. Jose Arcadio Segundo was put in jail because he revealed that the scrip </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">system was a way for the company to finance its fruit ships; which without the commissary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">merchandise would have to return empty from New Orleans to the banana ports. The other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complaints were common knowledge. The company physicians did not examine the sick but had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them line up behind one another in the dispensaries and a nurse would put a pill the color of copper </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sulfate on their tongues, whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation. It was a cure that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so common that children would stand in line several times and instead of swallowing the pills would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take them home to use as bingo markers. The company workers were crowded together in miserable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barracks. The engineers, instead of putting in toilets, had a portable latrine for every fifty people </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought to the camps at Christmas time and they held public demonstrations of how to use them so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that they would last longer. The decrepit lawyers dressed in black who during other times had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">besieged Colonel Aureliano Buendia and who now were controlled by the banana company </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dismissed those demands with decisions that seemed like acts of magic. When the workers drew up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a list of unanimous petitions, a long time passed before they were able to notify the banana company </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officially. As soon as he found out about the agreement Mr. Brown hitched his luxurious glassed-in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">coach to the train and disappeared from Macondo along with the more prominent representatives of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his company. Nonetheless some workers found one of them the following Saturday in a brothel and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they made him sign a copy of the sheet with the demands while he was naked with the women who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had helped to entrap him. The mournful lawyers showed in court that that man had nothing to do </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the company and in order that no one doubt their arguments they had him jailed as an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impostor. Later on, Mr. Brown was surprised traveling incognito, in a third-class coach and they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made him sign another copy of the demands. On the following day he appeared before the judges </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with his hair dyed black and speaking flawless Spanish. The lawyers showed that the man was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mr. Jack Brown, the superintendent of the banana company, born in Prattville Alabama, but a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">harmless vendor of medicinal plants, born in Macondo and baptized there with the name of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dagoberto Fonseca. A while later, faced with a new attempt by the workers the lawyers publicly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exhibited Mr. Brown&rsquo;s death certificate, attested to by consuls and foreign ministers which bore </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">147 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">witness that on June ninth last he had been run over by a fire engine in Chicago. Tired of that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hermeneutical delirium, the workers turned away from the authorities in Macondo and brought their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complaints up to the higher courts. It was there that the sleight-of-hand lawyers proved that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">demands lacked all validity for the simple reason that the banana company did not have, never had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had, and never would have any workers in its service because they were all hired on a temporary and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">occasional basis. So that the fable of the Virginia ham was nonsense, the same as that of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">miraculous pills and the Yuletide toilets, and by a decision of the court it was established and set </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down in solemn decrees that the workers did not exist. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The great strike broke out. Cultivation stopped halfway, the fruit rotted on the trees and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred-twenty-car trains remained on the sidings. The idle workers overflowed the towns. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Street of the Turks echoed with a Saturday that lasted for several days and in the poolroom at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hotel Jacob they had to arrange twenty-four-hour shifts. That was where Jose Arcadio Segundo was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the day it was announced that the army had been assigned to reestablish public order. Although </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was not a man given to omens, the news was like an announcement of death that he had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting for ever since that distant morning when Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had let him see an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">execution. The bad omen did not change his solemnity, however. He took the shot he had planned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and it was good. A short time later the dmmbeats, the shrill of the bugle, the shouting and running </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the people told him that not only had the game of pool come to an end, but also the silent and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitary game that he had been playing with himself ever since that dawn execution. Then he went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out into the street and saw them. There were three regiments, whose march in time to a galley dmm </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made the earth tremble. Their snorting of a many-headed dragon filled the glow of noon with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pestilential vapor. They were short, stocky, and brutelike. They perspired with the sweat of a horse </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and had a smell of suntanned hide and the taciturn and impenetrable perseverance of men from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">uplands. Although it took them over an hour to pass by, one might have thought that they were only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a few squads marching in a circle, because they were all identical, sons of the same bitch, and with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the same stolidity they all bore the weight of their packs and canteens, the shame of their rifles with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fixed bayonets, and the chancre of blind obedience and a sense of honor. Ursula heard them pass </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from her bed in the shadows and she made a crow with her fingers. Santa Sofia de la Piedad existed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for an instant, leaning over the embroidered tablecloth that she had just ironed, and she thought of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her son, Jose Arcadio Segundo, who without changing expression watched the last soldiers pass by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the door of the Hotel Jacob. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Martial law enabled the army to assume the functions of arbitrator in the controversy, but no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">effort at conciliation was made. As soon as they appeared in Macondo, the soldiers put aside their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rifles and cut and loaded the bananas and started the trains mnning. The workers, who had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">content to wait until then, went into the woods with no other weapons but their working machetes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and they began to sabotage the sabotage. They burned plantations and commissaries, tore up tracks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to impede the passage of the trains that began to open their path with machine-gun fire, and they cut </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">telegraph and telephone wires. The irrigation ditches were stained with blood. Mr. Brown, who was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">alive in the electrified chicken coop, was taken out of Macondo with his family and those of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fellow countrymen and brought to a safe place under the protection of the army. The situation was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">threatening to lead to a bloody and unequal civil war when the authorities called upon the workers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to gather in Macondo. The summons announced that the civil and military leader of the province </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would arrive on the following Friday ready to intercede in the conflict. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo was in the crowd that had gathered at the station on Friday since early in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the morning. He had taken part in a meeting of union leaders and had been commissioned, along </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with Colonel Gavilan, to mingle in the crowd and orient it according to how things went. He did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">feel well and a salty paste was beginning to collect on his palate when he noticed that the army had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">set up machine-gun emplacements around the small square and that the wired city of the banana </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">148 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">company was protected by artillery pieces. Around twelve o&rsquo;clock, waiting for a train that was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arriving, more than three thousand people, workers, women, and children, had spilled out of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">open space in front of the station and were pressing into the neighboring streets, which the army </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had closed off with rows of machine guns. At that time it all seemed more like a jubilant fair than a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting crowd. They had brought over the fritter and drink stands from the Street of the Turks and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the people were in good spirits as they bore the tedium of waiting and the scorching sun. A short </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time before three o&rsquo;clock the mmor spread that the official train would not arrive until the following </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day. The crowd let out a sigh of disappointment. An army lieutenant then climbed up onto the roof </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the station where there were four machine-gun emplacements aiming at the crowd and called for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">silence. Next to Jose Arcadio Segundo there was a barefooted woman, very fat, with two children </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">between the ages of four and seven. She was carrying the smaller one and she asked Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo, without knowing him, if he would lift up the other one so that he could hear better. Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo put the child on his shoulders. Many years later that child would still tell, to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disbelief of all, that he had seen the lieutenant reading Decree No. 4 of the civil and military leader </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the province through an old phonograph horn. It had been signed by General Carlos Cortes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vargas and his secretary. Major Enrique Garcia Isaza, and in three articles of eighty words he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">declared the strikers to be a &ldquo;bunch of hoodlums&rdquo; and he authorized the army to shoot to kill. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the decree was read, in the midst of a deafening hoot of protest, a captain took the place of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the lieutenant on the roof of the station and with the horn he signaled that he wanted to speak. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crowd was quiet again. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; the captain said in a low voice that was slow and a little tired, &ldquo;you have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">five minutes to withdraw.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The redoubled hooting and shouting drowned out the bugle call that announced the start of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">count. No one moved. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five minutes have passed,&rdquo; the captain said in the same tone. &ldquo;One more minute and we&rsquo;ll open </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fire.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo, sweating ice, lowered the child and gave him to the woman. &ldquo;Those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bastards might just shoot,&rdquo; she murmured. Jose Arcadio Segundo did not have time to speak </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because at that instant he recognized the hoarse voice of Colonel Gavilan echoing the words of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman with a shout. Intoxicated by the tension, by the miraculous depth of the silence, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">furthermore convinced that nothing could move that crowd held tight in a fascination with death, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo raised himself up over the heads in front of him and for the first time in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">life he raised his voice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You bastards!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Take the extra minute and stick it up your ass!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After his shout something happened that did not bring on fright but a kind of hallucination. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machine guns answered at once. But it all seemed like a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">farce. It was as if the machine guns had been loaded with caps, because their panting rattle could be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heard and their incandescent spitting could be seen, but not the slightest reaction was perceived, not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a cry, not even a sigh among the compact crowd that seemed petrified by an instantaneous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invulnerability. Suddenly, on one side-of the station, a cry of death tore open the enchantment: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aaaagh, Mother.&rdquo; A seismic voice, a volcanic breath, the roar of a cataclysm broke out in the center </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the crowd with a great potential of expansion. Jose Arcadio Segundo barely had time to pick up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the child while the mother with the other one was swallowed up by the crowd that swirled about in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">panic. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many years later that child would still tell, in spite of people thinking that he was a crazy old man, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">how Jose Arcadio Segundo had lifted him over his head and hauled him, almost in the air, as if </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">floating on the terror of the crowd, toward a nearby street. The child&rsquo;s privileged position allowed </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">149 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him to see at that moment that the wild mass was starting to get to the comer and the row of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">machine guns opened fire. Several voices shouted at the same time: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get down! Get down!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people in front had already done so, swept down by the wave of bullets. The survivors, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">instead of getting down, tried to go back to the small square, and the panic became a dragon&rsquo;s tail as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one compact wave ran against another which was moving in the opposite direction, toward the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other dragon&rsquo;s tail In the street across the way, where the machine guns were also firing without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cease. They were Penned in. swirling about in a gigantic whirlwind that little by little was being </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reduced to its epicenter as the edges were systematically being cut off all around like an onion being </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">peeled by the insatiable and methodical shears of the machine guns. The child saw a woman </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kneeling with her arms in the shape of a cross in an open space, mysteriously free of the stampede. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo put him up there at the moment he fell with his face bathed in blood, before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the colossal troop wiped out the empty space, the kneeling woman, the light of the high, drought- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stricken sky, and the whorish world where Ursula Iguaran had sold so many little candy animals. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Jose Arcadio Segundo came to he was lying face up in the darkness. He realized that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was riding on an endless and silent train and that his head was caked with dry blood and that all his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bones ached. He felt an intolerable desire to sleep. Prepared to sleep for many hours, safe from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">terror and the horror, he made himself comfortable on the side that pained him less, and only then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did he discover that he was lying against dead people. There was no free space in the car except for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an aisle in the middle. Several hours must have passed since the massacre because the corpses had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the same temperature as a plaster in autumn and the same consistency of petrified foam that it had, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and those who had put them in the car had had time to pile them up in the same way in which they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">transported bunches of bananas. Trying to flee from the nightmare, Jose Arcadio Segundo dragged </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself from one car to an other in the direction in which the train was heading, and in the flashes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of light that broke through the wooden slats as they went through sleeping towns he saw the man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">corpses, woman corpses, child corpses who would be thrown into the sea like rejected bananas. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recognized only a woman who sold drinks in the square and Colonel Gavilan, who still held </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrapped in his hand the belt with a buckle of Morelia silver with which he had tried to open his way </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the panic. When he got to the first car he jumped into the darkness and lay beside the tracks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">until the train had passed. It was the longest one he had ever seen, with almost two hundred freight </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cars and a locomotive at either end and a third one in the middle. It had no lights, not even the red </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and green running lights, and it slipped off with a nocturnal and stealthy velocity. On top of the cars </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there could be seen the dark shapes of the soldiers with their emplaced machine guns. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After midnight a torrential cloudburst came up. Jose Arcadio Segundo did not know where it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he had jumped off, but he knew that by going in the opposite direction to that of the train he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would reach Macondo. After walking for more than three hours, soaked to the skin, with a terrible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">headache, he was able to make out the first houses in the light of dawn. Attracted by the smell of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">coffee, he went into a kitchen where a woman with a child in her arms was leaning over the stove. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, exhausted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jose Arcadio Segundo Buendia.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He pronounced his whole name, letter by letter, in order to convince her that he was alive. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was wise in doing so, because the woman had thought that he was an apparition as she saw the dirty, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shadowy figure with his head and clothing dirty with blood and touched with the solemnity of death </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come through the door. She recognized him. She brought him a blanket so that he could wrap </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself up while his clothes dried by the fire, she warmed some water to wash his wound, which was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only a flesh wound, and she gave him a clean diaper to bandage his head. Then she gave him a mug </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of coffee without sugar as she had been told the Buendias drank it, and she spread his clothing out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">near the fire. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo did not speak until he had finished drinking his coffee. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">150 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There must have been three thousand of them&rdquo; he murmured. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The dead,&rdquo; he clarified. &ldquo;It must have been an of the people who were at the station.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman measured him with a pitying look. &ldquo;There haven&rsquo;t been any dead here,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since the time of your uncle, the colonel, nothing has happened in Macondo.&rdquo; In the three kitchens </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where Jose Arcadio Segundo stopped before reaching home they told him the same thing. &ldquo;There </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weren&rsquo;t any dead. He went through the small square by the station and he saw the fritter stands piled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one on top of the other and he could find no trace of the massacre. The streets were deserted under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the persistent rain and the houses locked up with no trace of life inside. The only human note was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the first tolling of the bells for mass. He knocked at the door at Colonel Gavilan&rsquo;s house. A pregnant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman whom he had seen several times closed the door in his face. &ldquo;He left,&rdquo; she said, frightened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He went back to his own country.&rdquo; The main entrance to the wire chicken coop was guarded as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">always by two local policemen who looked as if they were made of stone under the rain, with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">raincoats and mbber boots. On their marginal street the West Indian Negroes were singing Saturday </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">psalms. Jose Arcadio Segundo jumped over the courtyard wall and entered the house through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kitchen. Santa Sofia de la Piedad barely raised her voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Fernanda see you,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just getting up.&rdquo; As if she were fulfilling an implicit pact, she took her son to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;chamberpot room.&rdquo; arranged Melquiades&rsquo; broken-down cot for him and at two in the afternoon, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">while Fernanda was taking her siesta, she passed a plate of food in to him through the window. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo had slept at home because the rain had caught him time and at three in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">afternoon he was still waiting for it to clear. Informed in secret by Santa Sofia de la Piedad, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">visited his brother in Melquiades&rsquo; room at that time. He did not believe the version of the massacre </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">or the nightmare trip of the train loaded with corpses traveling toward the sea either. The night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before he had read an extraordinary proclamation to the nation which said that the workers had left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the station and had returned home in peaceful groups. The proclamation also stated that the union </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leaders, with great patriotic spirit, had reduced their demands to two points: a reform of medical </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">services and the building of latrines in the living quarters. It was stated later that when the military </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">authorities obtained the agreement with the workers, they hastened to tell Mr. Brown and he not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only accepted the new conditions but offered to pay for three days of public festivities to celebrate </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the end of the conflict. Except that when the military asked him on what date they could announce </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the signing of the agreement, he looked out the window at the sky crossed with lightning flashes and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made a profound gesture of doubt. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When the rain stops,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As long as the rain lasts we&rsquo;re suspending all activities.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had not rained for three months and there had been a drought. But when Mr. Brown </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">announced his decision a torrential downpour spread over the whole banana region. It was the one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that caught Jose Arcadio Segundo on his way to Macondo. A week later it was still raining. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">official version, repeated a thousand times and mangled out all over the country by every means of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">communication the government found at hand, was finally accepted: there were no dead, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">satisfied workers had gone back to their families, and the banana company was suspending all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">activity until the rains stopped. Martial law continued with an eye to the necessity of taking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">emergency measures for the public disaster of the endless downpour, but the troops were confined </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to quarters. During the day the soldiers walked through the torrents in the streets with their pant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">legs rolled up, playing with boats with the children. At night after taps, they knocked doors down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with their rifle butts, hauled suspects out of their beds, and took them off on trips from which there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was no return. The search for and extermination of the hoodlums, murderers, arsonists, and rebels </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of Decree No. 4 was still going on, but the military denied it even to the relatives of the victims who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crowded the commandant&rsquo;s offices in search of news. &ldquo;You must have been dreaming,&rdquo; the officers </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">151 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insisted. &ldquo;Nothing has happened in Macondo, nothing has ever happened, and nothing ever will </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">happen. &ldquo;This is a happy town.&rdquo; In that way they were finally able to wipe out the union leaders. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only survivor was Jose Arcadio Segundo. One February night the unmistakable blows of rifle </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">butts were heard at the door. Aureliano Segundo, who was still waiting for it to clear, opened the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">door to six soldiers under the command of an officer. Soaking from the rain, without saying a word, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they searched the house room by room, closet by closet, from parlor to pantry. Ursula woke up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when they turned on the light in her room and she did not breathe while the march went on but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">held her fingers in the shape of a cross, pointing them to where the soldiers were moving about. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Santa Sofia de la Piedad managed to warn Jose Arcadio Segundo, who was sleeping in Melquiades&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room, but he could see that it was too late to try to escape. So Santa Sofia de la Piedad locked the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">door again and he put on his shirt and his shoes and sat down on the cot to wait for them. At that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment they were searching the gold workshop. The officer made them open the padlock and with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a quick sweep of his lantern he saw the workbench and the glass cupboard with bottles of acid and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">instruments that were still where their owner had left them and he seemed to understand that no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one lived in that room. He wisely asked Aureliano Segundo if he was a silversmith, however, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">latter explained to him that it had been Colonel Aureliano Buendia&rsquo;s workshop. &ldquo;Oho,&rdquo; the officer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said, turned on the lights, and ordered such a minute search that they did not miss the eighteen little </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gold fishes that had not been melted down and that were hidden behind the bottles Is their tin can. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The officer examined them one by one on the workbench and then he turned human. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take one, if I may,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At one time they were a mark of subversion, but now they&rsquo;re relics.&rdquo; - </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was young, almost an adolescent, with no sign of timidity and with a natural pleasant manner </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that had not shown itself until then. Aureliano Segundo gave him the little fish. The officer put it in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his shirt pocket with a childlike glow in his eyes and he put the others back in the can and set it back </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where it had been. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful memento,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Colonel Aureliano Buendfa was one of our greatest men.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, that surge of humanity did not alter his professional conduct. At Melquiades&rsquo; room, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which was locked up again with the padlock, Santa Sofia de la Piedad tried one last hope. &ldquo;No one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">has lived in that room for a century,&rdquo; she said. The officer had it opened and flashed the beam of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the lantern over it, and Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofia de la Piedad saw the Arab eyes of Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo at the moment when the ray of light passed over his face and they understood that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it was the end of one anxiety and the beginning of another which would find relief only in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">resignation. But the officer continued examining the room with the lantern and showed no sign of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interest until he discovered the seventy-two chamberpots piled up in the cupboards. Then he turned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the light. Jose Arcadio Segundo was sitting on the edge of the cot, ready to go, more solemn and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pensive than ever. In the background were the shelves with the shredded books, the rolls of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parchment, and the clean and orderly worktable with the ink still fresh in the inkwells. There was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same pureness in the air, the same clarity, the same respite from dust and destruction that Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo had known in childhood and that only Colonel Aureliano Buendia could not perceive. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the officer was only interested in the chamberpots. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How many people live in this house?&rsquo; he asked. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Five.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The officer obviously did not understand. He paused with his glance on the space where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo and Santa Soft de la Piedad were still seeing Jose Arcadio Segundo and the latter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">also realized that the soldier was looking at him without seeing him. Then he turned out the light </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and closed the door. When he spoke to the soldiers, Aureliano, Segundo understood that the young </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">officer had seen the room with the same eyes as Colonel Aureliano Buendia. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious that no one has been in that room for at least a hundred years.&rdquo; the officer said to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the soldiers. &ldquo;There must even be snakes in there.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">152 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the door closed, Jose Arcadio Segundo was sure that the war was over. Years before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendla had spoken to him about the fascination of war and had tried to show it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to him with countless examples drawn from his own experience. He had believed him. But the night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when the soldiers looked at him without seeing him while he thought about the tension of the past </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">few months, the misery of jail, the panic at the station, and the train loaded with dead people, Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo reached the conclusion that Colonel Aureliano Buendia was nothing but a faker or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an imbecile. He could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">war because one was enough: fear. In Melquiades&rsquo; room, on the other hand, protected by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">supernatural light, by the sound of the rain, by the feeling of being invisible, he found the repose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he had not had for one single instant during his previous life, and the only fear that remained </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was that they would bury him alive. He told Santa Sofia de la Piedad about it when she brought him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his daily meals and she promised to struggle to stay alive even beyond her natural forces in order to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">make sure that they would bury him dead. Free from all fear, Jose Arcadio Segundo dedicated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself then to pemse the manuscripts of Melquiades many times, and with so much more pleasure </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when he could not understand them. He became accustomed to the sound of the rain, which after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two months had become another form of silence, and the only thing that disturbed his solitude was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the coming and going of Santa Sofia de la Piedad. He asked her, therefore, to leave the meals on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">windowsill and padlock the door. The rest of the family forgot about him including Fernanda, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not mind leaving him there when she found that the soldiers had seen him without recognizing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him. After six months of enclosure, since the soldiers had left Macondo Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">removed the padlock, looking for someone he could talk to until the rain stopped. As soon as he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opened the door he felt the pestilential attack of the chamberpots, which were placed on the floor </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and all of which had been used several times. Jose Arcadio Segundo, devoured by baldness, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">indifferent to the air that had been sharpened by the nauseating vapors, was still reading and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rereading the unintelligible parchments. He was illuminated by a seraphic glow. He scarcely raised </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his eyes when he heard the door open, but that look was enough for his brother to see repeated in it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the irreparable fate of his great-grandfather. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There were more than three thousand of them,&rdquo; was all that Jose Arcadio Segundo said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sure now that they were everybody who had been at the station.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">153 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 16 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">IT RAINED FOR four years, eleven months, and two days. There were periods of drizzle during which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everyone put on his full dress and a convalescent look to celebrate the clearing, but the people soon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grew accustomed to interpret the pauses as a sign of redoubled rain. The sky cmmbled into a set of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">destructive storms and out of the north came hurricanes that scattered roofs about and knocked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down walls and uprooted every last plant of the banana groves. Just as during the insomnia plague, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as Ursula came to remember during those days, the calamity itself inspired defenses against </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">boredom. Aureliano Segundo was one of those who worked hardest not to be conquered by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">idleness. He had gone home for some minor matter on the night that Mr. Brown unleashed the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">storm, and Fernanda tried to help him with a half-blown-out umbrella that she found in a closet. &ldquo;I </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay until it clears.&rdquo; That was not, of course, an ironclad promise, but he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would accomplish it literally. Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes&rsquo;s, every three days he would take </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off what he had on and wait in his shorts until they washed. In order not to become bored, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dedicated himself to the task of repairing the many things that needed fixing in the house. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">adjusted hinges, oiled locks, screwed knockers tight, and planed doorjambs. For several months he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was seen wandering about with a toolbox that the gypsies must have left behind in Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia&rsquo;s days, and no one knew whether because of the involuntary exercise, the winter tedium or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the imposed abstinence, but his belly was deflating little by little like a wineskin and his face of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beatific tortoise was becoming less bloodshot and his double chin less prominent until he became </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">less pachydermic all over and was able to tie Iris own shoes again. Watching him putting in latches </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and repairing clocks, Fernanda wondered whether or not he too might be falling into the vice of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">building so that he could take apart like Colonel Aureliano Buendia and his little gold fishes, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta and her shroud and her buttons, Jose Arcadio and the parchments, and Ursula and her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memories. But that was not the case. The worst part was that the rain was affecting everything and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the driest of machines would have flowers popping out among their gears if they were not oiled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">every three days, and the threads in brocades msted, and wet clothing would break out in a rash of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saffron-colored moss. The air was so damp that fish could have come in through the doors and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">swum out the windows, floating through the atmosphere in the rooms. One morning Ursula woke </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up feeling that she was reaching her end in a placid swoon and she had already asked them to take </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her to Father Antonio Isabel, even if it had to be on a stretcher, when Santa Sofia de la Piedad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discovered that her back was paved with leeches. She took them off one by one, crushing them with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a firebrand before they bled her to death. It was necessary to dig canals to get the water out of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house and rid it of the frogs and snails so that they could dry the floors and take the bricks from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">under the bedposts and walk in shoes once more. Occupied with the many small details that called </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for his attention, Aureliano Segundo did not realize that he was getting old until one afternoon when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he found himself contemplating the premature dusk from a rocking chair and thinking about Petra </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cotes without quivering. There would have been no problem in going back to Fernanda&rsquo;s insipid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">love, because her beauty had become solemn with age, but the rain had spared him from all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">emergencies of passion and had filled him with the spongy serenity of a lack of appetite. He amused </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself thinking about the things that he could have done in other times with that rain which had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">already lasted a year. He had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo, much earlier </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than their popularization by the banana company, simply to roof Petra Cotes&rsquo;s bedroom with them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and to take pleasure in the feeling of deep intimacy that the sprinkling of the rain produced at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time. But even those wild memories of his mad youth left him unmoved, just as during his last </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">debauch he had exhausted his quota of salaciousness and all he had left was the marvelous gift of </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">154 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being able to remember it without bitterness or repentance. It might have been thought that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and reflect and that the business of the pliers and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">oilcan had awakened in him the tardy yearning of so many useful trades that he might have followed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in his life and did not; but neither case was tme, because the temptation of a sedentary domesticity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was besieging him was not the result of any rediscovery or moral lesion, it came from much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">farther off, unearthed by the rain&rsquo;s pitchfork from the days when in Melquiades&rsquo; room he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">read the prodigious fables about flying carpets and whales that fed on entire ships and their crews. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was during those days that in a moment of carelessness little Aureliano appeared on the porch and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inis grandfather recognized the secret of his identity. He cut Inis hair, dressed him taught him not to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">be afraid of people, and very soon it was evident that he was a legitimate Aureliano Buendia, with his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">high cheekbones, his startled look, and his solitary air. It was a relief for Fernanda. For some time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had measured the extent of her pridefulness, but she could not find any way to remedy it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because the more she thought of solutions the less rational they seemed to her. If she had known </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Aureliano Segundo was going to take things the way he did, with the fine pleasure of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandfather, she would not have taken so many turns or got so mixed up, but would have freed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">herself from mortification the year before Amaranta Ursula, who already had her second teeth, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought of her nephew as a scurrying toy who was a consolation for the tedium of the rain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo remembered then the English encyclopedia that no one had since touched in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meme&rsquo;s old room. He began to show the children the pictures, especially those of animals, and later </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the maps and photographs of remote countries and famous people. Since he did not know any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">English and could identify only the most famous cities and people, he would invent names and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">legends to satisfy the children&rsquo;s insatiable curiosity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda really believed that her husband was waiting for it to clear to return to his concubine. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the first months of the rain she was afraid that he would try to slip into her bedroom and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she would have to undergo the shame of revealing to him that she was incapable of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reconciliation since the birth of Amaranta Ursula. That was the reason for her anxious correspon&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dence with the invisible doctors, intermpted by frequent disasters of the mail. During the first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months when it was learned that the trains were jumping their tracks in the rain, a letter from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invisible doctors told her that hers were not arriving. Later on, when contact with the unknown </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">correspondents was broken, she had seriously thought of putting on the tiger mask that her husband </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had worn in the bloody carnival and having herself examined under a fictitious name by the banana </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">company doctors. But one of the many people who regularly brought unpleasant news of the deluge </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had told her that the company was dismantling its dispensaries to move them to where it was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">raining. Then she gave up hope. She resigned herself to waiting until the rain stopped and the mail </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">service was back to normal, and in the meantime she sought relief from her secret ailments with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recourse to her imagination, because she would rather have died than put herself in the hands of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only doctor left in Macondo, the extravagant Frenchman who ate grass like a donkey. She drew close </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to Ursula, trusting that she would know of some palliative for her attacks. But her twisted habit of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not calling things by their names made her put first things last and use &ldquo;expelled&rdquo; for &ldquo;gave birth&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and &ldquo;burning&rdquo; for &ldquo;flow&rdquo; so that it would all be less shameful, with the result that Ursula reached </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the reasonable conclusion that her trouble was intestinal rather than uterine, and she advised her to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach. If it had not been for that suffering, which would have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had nothing shameful about it for someone who did not suffer as well from shamefulness, and if it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not been for the loss of the letters, the rain would not have bothered Fernanda, because, after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all, her whole life had been spent as if it had been raining. She did not change her schedule or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">modify her ritual. When the table was still raised up on bricks and the chairs put on planks so that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those at the table would not get their feet wet, she still served with linen tablecloths and fine </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chinaware and with lighted candles, because she felt that the calamities should not be used as a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">155 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pretext for any relaxation in customs. No one went out into the street any more. If it had depended </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on Fernanda, they would never have done so, not only since it started raining but since long before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that, because she felt that doors had been invented to stay closed and that curiosity for what was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">going on in the street was a matter for harlots. Yet she was the first one to look out when they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">told that the funeral procession for Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was passing by and even though she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only watched it through the half-opened window it left her in such a state of affliction that for a long </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time she repented in her weakness. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could not have conceived of a more desolate cortege. They had put the coffin in an oxcart </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over which they built a canopy of banana leaves, but the pressure of the rain was so intense and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">streets so muddy that with every step the wheels got stuck and the covering was on the verge of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">falling apart. The streams of sad water that fell on the coffin were soaking the flag that had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">placed on top which was actually the flag stained with blood and gunpowder that had been rejected </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by more honorable veterans. On the coffin they had also placed the saber with tassels of silver and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">copper, the same one that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez used to hang on the coat rack in order to go </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into Amaranta&rsquo;s sewing room unarmed. Behind the cart, some barefoot and all of them with their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pants rolled up, splashing in the mud were the last survivors of the surrender at Neerlandia carrying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a drover&rsquo;s staff in one hand and in the other a wreath of paper flowers that had become discolored </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the rain. They appeared like an unreal vision along the street which still bore the name of Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia and they all looked at the house as they passed and turned the corner at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">square, where they had to ask for help to move the cart, which was stuck. Ursula had herself carried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the door by Santa Sofia de la Piedad. She followed the difficulties of the procession with such </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention that no one doubted that she was seeing it, especially because her raised hand of an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">archangelic messenger was moving with the swaying of the cart. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good-bye, Gerineldo, my son,&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Say hello to my people and tell them I&rsquo;ll see them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when it stops raining.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo helped her back to bed and with the same informality with which he always </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">treated her, he asked her the meaning of her farewell. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only waiting for the rain to stop in order to die.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The condition of the streets alarmed Aureliano Segundo. He finally became worried about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">state of his animals and he threw an oilcloth over his head and sent to Petra Cotes&rsquo;s house. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found her in the courtyard, in the water up to her waist, trying to float the corpse of a horse. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo helped her with a lever, and the enormous swollen body gave a turn like a bell </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and was dragged away by the torrent of liquid mud. Since the rain began, all that Petra Cotes had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">done was to clear her courtyard of dead animals. During the first weeks she sent messages to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo for him to take urgent measures and he had answered that there was no msh, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the situation was not alarming, that there would be plenty of time to think about something </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when it cleared. She sent him word that the horse pastures were being flooded, that the cattle were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fleeing to high ground, where there was nothing to eat and where they were at the mercy of jaguars </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and sickness. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done,&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo answered her. &ldquo;Others will be born </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when it clears.&rdquo; Petra Cates had seen them die in dusters and the was able to butcher only those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stuck in the mud. She saw with quiet impotence how the deluge was pitilessly exterminating a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fortune that at one time was considered the largest and most solid in Macondo, and of which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nothing remained but pestilence. When Aureliano Segundo decided to go see what was going on, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found only the corpse of the horse and a squalid mule in the ruins of the stable. Petra Cotes watched </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him arrive without surprise, joy, or resentment, and she only allowed herself an ironic smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time!&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had aged, all skin and bones, and her tapered eyes of a carnivorous animal had become sad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and tame from looking at the rain so much. Aureliano Segundo stayed at her house more than three </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">156 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months, not because he felt better there than in that of his family, but because he needed all that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time to make the decision to throw the piece of oilcloth back over his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no rush,&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said, as he had said in the other home. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope that it clears in the next few hours.&rdquo; During the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">course of the first week he became accustomed to the inroads that time and the rain had made in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">health of his concubine, and little by little he was seeing her as she had been before, remembering </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her jubilant excesses and the delirious fertility that her love provoked in the animals, and partly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through love, partly through interest, one night during the second week he awoke her with urgent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">caresses. Petra Cotes did not react. &ldquo;Go back to sleep,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t times for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">things like that.&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo saw himself in the mirrors on the ceiling, saw Petra Cotes&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spinal column like a row of spools strung together along a cluster of withered nerves, and he saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she was right, not because of the times but because of themselves, who were no longer up to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those things. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo returned home with Inis tmnks, convinced that not only Ursula but all the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inhabitants of Macondo were waiting for it to dear in order to die. He had seen them as he passed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by, sitting in their parlors with an absorbed look and folded arms, feeling unbroken time pass, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">relentless times, because it was useless to divide it into months and years, and the days into hours, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when one could do nothing but contemplate the rain. The children greeted Aureliano Segundo with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">excitement because he was playing the asthmatic accordion for them again. But the concerts did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attract their attention as much as the sessions with the encyclopedia, and once more they got </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">together in Meme&rsquo;s room, where Aureliano Segundo&rsquo;s imagination changed a dirigible into a flying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">elephant who was looking for a place to sleep among the clouds. On one occasion he came across a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man on horseback who in spite of his strange outfit had a familiar look, and after examining him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">closely he came to the conclusion that it was a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. He showed it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to Fernanda and she also admitted the resemblance of the horseman not only to the colonel but to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everybody in the family, although he was actually a Tartar warrior. Time passed in that way with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colossus of Rhodes and snake charmers until his wife told him that there were only three pounds of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dried meat and a sack of rice left in the pantry. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what do you want me to do about it?&rdquo; he asked. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Fernanda answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Aureliano Segundo said, &ldquo;something will be done when it clears.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was more interested in the encyclopedia than In the domestic problem, even when he had to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">content himself with a scrap of meat and a little rice for lunch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to do anything now,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he would say. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t rain for the rest of our lives.&rdquo; And while the urgencies of the pantry grew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">greater, Fernanda&rsquo;s indignation also grew, until her eventual protests, her infrequent outbursts came </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forth in an uncontained, unchained torrent that begin one morning like the monotonous drone of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">guitar and as the day advanced rose in pitch, richer and more splendid. Aureliano Segundo was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">aware of the singsong until the following day after breakfast when he felt himself being bothered by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a buzzing that was by then more fluid and louder than the sound of the rain, and it was Fernanda, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who was walking throughout the house complaining that they had raised her to be a queen only to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have her end up as a servant in a madhouse, with a lazy, idolatrous, libertine husband who lay on his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back waiting for bread to rain down from heaven while she was straining her kidneys trying to keep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">afloat a home held together with pins where there was so much to do, so much to bear up under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and repair from the time God gave Inis morning sunlight until it was time to go to bed that when she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">got there her eyes were full of ground glass, and yet no one ever said to her, &ldquo;Good morning, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda, did you sleep well?&rdquo; Nor had they asked her, even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">why she awoke with purple rings under her eyes in spite of the fact that she expected it, of course, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from a family that had always considered her a nuisance, an old rag, a booby painted on the wall,

</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not meant for tasks of this world except to play the clavichord, and, nevertheless, her insane </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband had taken her from her home with all manner of admonitions and warnings and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought her to that frying pan of hell where a person could not breathe because of the heat,

class="c0"><span class="c1">was all that was needed by the only and beloved daughter of Dona Renata Argote and Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernando del Carpio, and especially the

to listen to her for a whole day until he caught her in a slip. Fernanda did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pay him any mind, but she lowered her voice. That night at dinner the exasperating buzzing of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">singsong had conquered the sound of the rain. Aureliano, Segundo ate very little, with his head </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down, and he went to his room early. At breakfast on the following day Fernanda was trembling, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a look of not having slept well, and she seemed completely exhausted by her rancor. Never&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">theless, when her husband asked if it was not possible to have a soft-boiled egg, she did not answer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">simply that they had run out of eggs the week before, but she worked up a violent diatribe against </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">men who spent their time contemplating their navels and then had the gall to ask for larks&rsquo; livers at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the table. Aureliano Segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia, as always, and Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pretended to straighten out Meme&rsquo;s room just so that he could listen to her muttering, of course, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it certainly took cheek for him to tell the poor innocents that there was a picture of Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia in the encyclopedia. During the afternoon, while the children were having their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nap, Aureliano Segundo sat on the porch and Fernanda pursued him even there, provoking him, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tormenting him, hovering about him with her implacable horsefly buzzing, saying that, of course, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">while there was nothing to eat except stones, her husband was sitting there like a sultan of Persia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">watching it rain, because that was all he was, a slob, a sponge, a good-for-nothing, softer than cotton </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">batting, used to living off women and convinced that he had married Jonah&rsquo;s wife, who was so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">content with the story of the whale. Aureliano Segundo listened to her for more than two hours, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impassive, as if he were deaf. He did not interrupt her until late in the afternoon, when he could no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">longer bear the echo of the bass drum that was tormenting his head. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please shut up,&rdquo; he begged. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda, quite the contrary, raised her pitch. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any reason to shut up,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t want to listen to me can go someplace else.&rdquo; Then Aureliano Segundo lost </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">control. He stood up unhurriedly, as if he only intended to stretch, and with a perfectly regulated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and methodical fury he grabbed the pots with the begonias one after the other, those with the ferns, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the oregano, and one after the other he smashed them onto the floor. Fernanda was frightened </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because until then she had really not had a clear indication of the tremendous inner force of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">singsong, but it was too late for any attempt at rectification. Intoxicated by the uncontained torrent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of relief, Aureliano Segundo broke the glass on the china closet and piece by piece, without hurrying, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he took out the chinaware and shattered it on the floor. Systematically, serenely, in the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parsimonious way in which he had papered the house with banknotes, he then set about smashing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Bohemian crystal ware against the walls, the hand-painted vases, the pictures of maidens in flow&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">er-laden boats, the mirrors in their gilded frames, everything that was breakable, from parlor to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pantry, and he finished with the large earthen jar in the kitchen, which exploded in the middle of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard with a hollow boom. Then he washed his hands, threw the oilcloth over himself, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before midnight he returned with a few strings of dried meat, several bags of rice, corn with weevils, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and some emaciated bunches of bananas. From then on there was no more lack of food. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta Ursula and little Aureliano would remember the rains as a happy time. In spite of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda&rsquo;s strictness, they would splash in the puddles in the courtyard, catch lizards and dissect </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them, and pretend that they were poisoning the soup with dust from butterfly wings when Santa </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sofia de la Piedad was not looking Ursula was their most amusing plaything. They looked upon her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as a big,, broken-down doll that they carried back and forth from one corner to another wrapped in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colored cloth and with her face painted with soot and annatto, and once they were on the point of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plucking out her eyes with the pruning shears as they had done with the frogs. Nothing gave them as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much excitement as the wanderings of her mind. Something, indeed, must have happened to her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mind during the third year of the rain, for she was gradually losing her sense of reality and confusing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">present time with remote periods of her life to the point where, on one occasion, she spent three </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days weeping deeply over the death of Petronila Iguaran, her great-grandmother, buried for over a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">159 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">century. She sank into such an insane state of confusion that she thought little Aureliano was her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">son the colonel during the time he was taken to see ice, and that the Jose Arcadio who was at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time in the seminary was her firstborn who had gone off with the gypsies. She spoke so much about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the family that the children learned to make up imaginary visits with beings who had not only been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dead for a long time, but who had existed at different times. Sitting on the bed, her hair covered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with ashes and her face wrapped in a red kerchief, Ursula was happy in the midst of the unreal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">relatives whom the children described in all detail, as if they had really known them. Ursula would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">converse with her forebears about events that took place before her own existence, enjoying the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">news they gave her, and she would weep with them over deaths that were much more recent than </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the guests themselves. The children did not take long to notice that in the course of those ghostly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">visits Ursula would always ask a question destined to establish the one who had brought a life-size </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plaster Saint Joseph to the house to be kept until the rains stopped. It was in that way that Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo remembered the fortune buried in some place that only Ursula knew, but the questions and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">astute maneuvering that occurred to him were of no use because in the labyrinth of her madness she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seemed to preserve enough of a margin of lucidity to keep the secret which she would reveal only to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the one who could prove that he was the real owner of the buried gold. She was so skillful and strict </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that when Aureliano Segundo instmcted one of his carousing companions to pass himself off as the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">owner of the fortune, she got him all caught up in a minute interrogation sown with subtle traps. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Convinced that Ursula would carry the secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a crew of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">diggers under the pretext that they were making some drainage canals in the courtyard and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">backyard, and he himself took soundings in the earth with iron bars and all manner of metal- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">detectors without finding anything that resembled gold in three months of exhaustive exploration. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later on he went to Pilar Ternera with the hope that the cards would we more than the diggers, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she began by explaining that any attempt would be useless unless Ursula cut the cards. On the other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hand, she confirmed the existence of the treasure with the precision of its consisting of seven </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thousand two hundred fourteen coins buried in three canvas sacks reinforced with copper wire </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">within a circle with a radius of three hundred eighty-eight feet with Ursula&rsquo;s bed as the center, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she warned that it would not be found until it stopped raining and the suns of three consecutive </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Junes had changed the piles of mud into dust. The profusion and meticulous vagueness of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">information seemed to Aureliano Segundo so similar to the tales of spiritualists that he kept on with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his enterprise in spite of the fact that they were in August and they would have to wait at least three </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">years in order to satisfy the conditions of the prediction. The first thing that startled him, even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">though it increased his confusion at the same time, was the fact that it was precisely three hundred </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eighty-eight feet from Ursula&rsquo;s bed to the backyard wall. Fernanda feared that he was as crazy as his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twin brother when she saw him taking the measurements, and even more when he told the digging </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crew to make the ditches three feet deeper. Overcome by an exploratory delirium comparable only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to that of his great-grandfather when he was searching for the route of inventions, Aureliano Segun&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">do lost the last layers of fat that he had left and the old resemblance to his twin brother was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">becoming accentuated again, not only because of his slim figure, but also because of the distant air </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the withdrawn attitude. He no longer bothered with the children. He ate at odd hours, muddled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from head to toe, and he did so in a corner in the kitchen, barely answering the occasional questions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked by Santa Sofia de la Piedad. Seeing him work that way, as she had never dreamed him capable </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of doing, Fernanda thought that his stubbornness was diligence, his greed abnegation, and his thick&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">headedness perseverance, and her insides tightened with remorse over the vimlence with which she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had attacked his idleness. But Aureliano Segundo was in no mood for merciful reconciliations at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time. Sunk up to his neck in a morass of dead brandies and rotting flowers, he flung the dirt of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">garden all about after having finished with the courtyard and the backyard, and he excavated so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deeply under the foundations of the east wing of the house that one night they woke up in terror at </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">160 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what seemed to be an earthquake, as much because of the trembling as the fearful underground </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">creaking. Three of the rooms were collapsing and a frightening crack had opened up from the porch </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to Fernanda&rsquo;s room. Aureliano Segundo did not give up the search because of that. Even when his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">last hopes had been extinguished and the only thing that seemed to make any sense was what the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cards had predicted, he reinforced the jagged foundation, repaired the crack with mortar, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">continued on the side to the west. He was still there on the second week of the following June when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the rain began to abate and the clouds began to lift and it was obvious from one moment to the next </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it was going to clear. That was what happened. On Friday at two in the afternoon the world </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lighted up with a crazy crimson sun as harsh as brick dust and almost as cool as water, and it did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rain again for ten years. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo was in mins. In the swampy streets there were the remains of furniture, animal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">skeletons covered with red lilies, the last memories of the hordes of newcomers who had fled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo as wildly as they had arrived. The houses that had been built with such haste during the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">banana fever had been abandoned. The banana company tore down its installations. All that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remained of the former wired-in city were the ruins. The wooden houses, the cool terraces for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">breezy card-playing afternoons, seemed to have been blown away in an anticipation of the prophetic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wind that years later would wipe Macondo off the face of the earth. The only human trace left by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that voracious blast was a glove belonging to Patricia Brown in an automobile smothered in wild </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pansies. The enchanted region explored by Jose Arcadio Buendia in the days of the founding, where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">later on the banana plantations flourished, was a bog of rotting roots, on the horizon of which one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could manage to see the silent foam of the sea. Aureliano Segundo went through a crisis of affliction </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the first Sunday that he put on dry clothes and went out to renew his acquaintance with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">town. The survivors of the catastrophe, the same ones who had been living in Macondo before it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been struck by the banana company hurricane, were sitting in the middle of the street enjoying </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their first sunshine. They still had the green of the algae on their skin and the musty smell of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">corner that had been stamped on them by the rain, but in their hearts they seemed happy to have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recovered the town in which they had been born. The Street of the Turks was again what it had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been earlier, in the days when the Arabs with slippers and rings in their ears were going about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">world swapping knickknacks for macaws and had found in Macondo a good bend in the road where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they could find respite from their age-old lot as wanderers. Having crossed through to the other side </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the rain, the merchandise in the booths was falling apart, the cloths spread over the doors were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">splotched with mold, the counters undermined by termites, the walls eaten away by dampness, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Arabs of the third generation were sitting in the same place and in the same position as their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fathers and grandfathers, taciturn, dauntless, invulnerable to time and disaster, as alive or as dead as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had been after the insomnia plague and Colonel Aureliano Buendia&rsquo;s thirty-two wars. Their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strength of spirit in the face of ruins of the gaming tables, the fritter stands, the shooting galleries, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the alley where they interpreted dreams and predicted the future made Aureliano Segundo ask </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them with his usual informality what mysterious resources they had relied upon so as not to have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gone awash in the storm, what the devil they had done so as not to drown, and one after the other, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from door to door, they returned a crafty smile and a dreamy look, and without any previous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consultation they all gave the answer: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Swimming.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Petra Cotes was perhaps the only native who had an Arab heart. She had seen the final </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">destruction of her stables, her barns dragged off by the storm, but she had managed to keep her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house standing. During the second year she had sent pressing messages to Aureliano Segundo and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he had answered that he did not know when he would go back to her house, but that in any case he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would bring along a box of gold coins to pave the bedroom floor with. At that time she had dug </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deep into her heart, searching for the strength that would allow her to survive the misfortune, and </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">161 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had discovered a reflective and just rage with which she had sworn to restore the fortune </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">squandered by her lover and then wiped out by the deluge. It was such an unbreakable decision that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo went back to her house eight months after the last message and found her green </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disheveled, with sunken eyelids and skin spangled with mange, but she was writing out numbers on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">small pieces of paper to make a raffle. Aureliano Segundo was astonished, and he was so dirty and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so solemn that Petra Cotes almost believed that the one who had come to see her was not the lover </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of all her life but his twin brother. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Unless you plan to raffle off bones.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she told him to look in the bedroom and Aureliano Segundo saw the mule. Its skin was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clinging to its bones like that of its mistress, but it was just as alive and resolute as she. Petra Cotes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had fed it with her wrath, and when there was no more hay or corn or roots, she had given it shelter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in her own bedroom and fed it on the percale sheets, the Persian rugs, the plush bedspreads, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">velvet drapes, and the canopy embroidered with gold thread and silk tassels on the episcopal bed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">162 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 17 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">URSULA HAD to make a great effort to fulfill her promise to die when it cleared. The waves of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lucidity that were so scarce during the rains became more frequent after August, when an and wind </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to blow and suffocated the rose bushes and petrified the piles of mud, and ended up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scattering over Macondo the burning dust that covered the rusted zinc roofs and the age-old almond </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trees forever. Ursula cried in lamentation when she discovered that for more than three years she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been a plaything for the children. She washed her painted face, took off the strips of brightly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colored cloth, the dried lizards and frogs, and the rosaries and old Arab necklaces that they had hung </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all over her body, and for the first time since the death of Amaranta she got up out of bed without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anybody&rsquo;s help to join in the family life once more. The spirit of her invincible heart guided her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the shadows. Those who noticed her stumbling and who bumped into the archangelic arm </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she kept raised at head level thought that she was having trouble with her body, but they still did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">think she was blind. She did not need to see to realize that the flower beds, cultivated with such care </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since the first rebuilding, had been destroyed by the rain and mined by Aureliano Segundo&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">excavations, and that the walls and the cement of the floors were cracked, the furniture mushy and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discolored, the doors off their hinges, and the family menaced by a spirit of resignation and despair </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was inconceivable in her time. Feeling her way along through the empty bedrooms she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">perceived the continuous rumble of the termites as they carved the wood, the snipping of the moths </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the clothes closets, and the devastating noise of the enormous red ants that had prospered during </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the deluge and were undermining the foundations of the house. One day she opened the tmnk with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the saints and had to ask Santa Sofia de la Piedad to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out and that had already turned the clothing to dust. &ldquo;A person can&rsquo;t live in neglect like this,&rdquo; she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said. &ldquo;If we go on like this we&rsquo;ll be devoured by animals.&rdquo; From then on she did not have a moment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of repose. Up before dawn, she would use anybody available, even the children. She put the few </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">articles of clothing that were still usable out into the sun, she drove the cockroaches off with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">powerful insecticide attacks, she scratched out the veins that the termites had made on doors and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">windows and asphyxiated the ants in their anthills with quicklime. The fever of restoration finally </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought her to the forgotten rooms. She cleared out the rubble and cobwebs in the room where Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendfa had lost his wits looking for the Philosopher&rsquo;s stone, she put the silver shop which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been upset by the soldiers in order, and lastly she asked for the keys to Melquiades&rsquo; room to see </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what state it was in. Faithful to the wishes of Jose Arcadio Segundo, who had forbidden anyone to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">come in unless there was a clear indication that he had died, Santa Sofia de la Piedad tried all kinds </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of subterfuges to throw Ursula off the track. But so inflexible was her determination not to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surrender even the most remote corner of the house to the insects that she knocked down every </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">obstacle in her path, and after three days of insistence she succeeded in getting them to open the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">door for her. She had to hold on to the doorjamb so that the stench would not knock her over, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she needed only two seconds to remember that the schoolgirls&rsquo; seventy-two chamberpots were in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there and that on one of the rainy nights a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Segundo and had been unable to find him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lord save us!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as if she could see everything. &ldquo;So much trouble teaching you </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">good manners and you end up living like a pig.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Segundo was still reading over the parchments. The only thing visible in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intricate tangle of hair was the teeth striped with green dime and his motionless eyes. When he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recognized his great-grandmother&rsquo;s voice he turned his head toward the door, tried to smile, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without knowing it repeated an old phrase of Ursula&rsquo;s. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">163 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Time passes.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it goes,&rdquo; Ursula said, &ldquo;but not so much.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she said it she realized that she was giving the same reply that Colonel Aureliano Buendia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had given in his death cell, and once again she shuddered with the evidence that time was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passing, as she had just admitted, but that it was turning in a circle. But even then she did not give </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">resignation a chance. She scolded Jose Arcadio Segundo as if he were a child and insisted that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixing up the house. The simple idea of abandoning the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room that had given him peace terrified Jose Arcadio Segundo. He shouted that there was no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">human power capable of making him go out because he did not want to see the train with two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred cars loaded with dead people which left Macondo every day at dusk on its way to the sea. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They were all of those who were at the station,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Three thousand four hundred eight.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only then did Ursula realize that he was in a world of shadows more impenetrable than hers, as un&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reachable and solitary as that of his great-grandfather. She left him in the room, but she succeeded in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">getting them to leave the padlock off, clean it every day, throw the chamberpots away except for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one, and to keep Jose Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as Iris great-grandfather had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">during his long captivity under the chestnut tree. At first Fernanda interpreted that bustle as an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attack of senile madness and it was difficult for her to suppress her exasperation. But about that time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio told her that he planned to come to Macondo from Rome before taking his final vows, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that from morning to night she would be seen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">watering the flowers four times a day so that her son would not have a bad impression of the house. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was that same incentive which induced her to speed up her correspondence with the invisible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doctors and to replace the pots of ferns and oregano and the begonias on the porch even before </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureliano Segundo&rsquo;s exterminating fury. Later on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she sold the silver service and bought ceramic dishes, pewter bowls and soup spoons, and alpaca </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tablecloths, and with them brought poverty to the cupboards that had been accustomed to India </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Company chinaware and Bohemian crystal. Ursula always tried to go a step beyond. &ldquo;Open the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">windows and the doors,&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Cook some meat and fish, buy the largest turtles around, let </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strangers come and spread their mats in the corners and urinate in the rose bushes and sit down to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eat as many times as they want and belch and rant and muddy everything with their boots, and let </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them do whatever they want to us, because that&rsquo;s the only way to drive off rain.&rdquo; But it was a vain </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">illusion. She was too old then and living on borrowed time to repeat the miracle of the little candy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">animals, and none of her descendants had inherited her strength. The house stayed closed on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda&rsquo;s orders. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo, who had taken his tmnks back to the house of Petra Cotes, barely had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough means to see that the family did not starve to death. With the raffling of the mule, Petra </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cotes and he bought some more animals with which they managed to set up a primitive lottery </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">business. Aureliano Segundo would go from house to house selling the tickets that he himself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">painted with colored ink to make them more attractive and convincing, and perhaps he did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">realize that many people bought them out of gratitude and most of them out of pity. Nevertheless, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even the most pitying purchaser was getting a chance to win a pig for twenty cents or a calf for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thirty-two, and they became so hopeful that on Tuesday nights Petra Cotes&rsquo;s courtyard overflowed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with people waiting for the moment when a child picked at random drew the winning number from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a bag. It did not take long to become a weekly fair, for at dusk food and drink stands would be set </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up in the courtyard and many of those who were favored would slaughter the animals they had won </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">right there on the condition that someone else supply the liquor and music, so that without having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted to, Aureliano Segundo suddenly found himself playing the accordion again and participating </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in modest tourneys of voracity. Those humble replicas of the revelry of former times served to show </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo himself how much his spirits had declined and to what a degree his skill as a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">164 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">masterful carouser had dried up. He was a changed man. The two hundred forty pounds that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attained during the days when he had been challenged by The Elephant had been reduced to one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred fifty-six; the glowing and bloated tortoise face had turned into that of an iguana, and he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">always on the verge of boredom and fatigue. For Petra Cotes, however, he had never been a better </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man than at that time, perhaps because the pity that he inspired was mixed with love, and because of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the feeling of solidarity that misery aroused in both of them. The broken-down bed ceased to be the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scene of wild activities and was changed into an intimate refuge. Freed of the repetitious mirrors, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which had been auctioned off to buy animals for the lottery, and from the lewd damasks and velvets, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which the mule had eaten, they would stay up very late with the innocence of two sleepless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandparents, taking advantage of the time to draw up accounts and put away pennies which they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">formerly wasted just for the sake of it. Sometimes the cock&rsquo;s crow would find them piling and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unpiling coins, taking a bit away from here to put there, to that this bunch would be enough to keep </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda happy and that would be for Amaranta Ursula&rsquo;s shoes, and that other one for Santa Sofia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">de la Piedad, who had not had a new dress since the time of all the noise, and this to order the coffin </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">if Ursula died, and this for the coffee which was going up a cent a pound in price every three </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months, and this for the sugar which sweetened less every day, and this for the lumber which was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">still wet from the rains, and this other one for the paper and the colored ink to make tickets with, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and what was left over to pay off the winner of the April calf whose hide they had miraculously </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saved when it came down with a symptomatic carbuncle just when all of the numbers in the raffle </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had already been sold. Those rites of poverty were so pure that they nearly always set aside the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">largest share for Fernanda, and they did not do so out of remorse or charity, but because her well&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being was more important to them than their own. What was really happening to them, although </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">neither of them realized it, was that they both thought of Fernanda as the daughter that they would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have liked to have and never did, to the point where on a certain occasion they resigned themselves </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to eating crumbs for three days, so that she could buy a Dutch tablecloth. Nevertheless, no matter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">how much they killed themselves with work, no matter how much money they eked out, and no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">matter how many schemes they thought of, their guardian angels were asleep with fatigue while they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put in coins and took them out trying to get just enough to live with. During the waking hours when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the accounts were bad. they wondered what had happened in the world for the animals not to breed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the same drive as before, why money slipped through their fingers, and why people who a short </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time before had burned rolls of bills in the carousing considered it highway robbery to charge twelve </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cents for a raffle of six hens. Aureliano Segundo thought without saying so that the evil was not in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the world but in some hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">happened during the deluge that had turned the animals sterile and made money scarce. Intrigued by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that enigma, he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to fund the paradise of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">loving each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were two worn-out old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dogs. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The raffles never got very far. At first Aureliano Segundo would spend three days of the week </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shut up in what had been Iris rancher&rsquo;s office drawing ticket after ticket, Painting with a fair skill a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">red cow, a green pig, or a group of blue hens, according to the animal being raffled, and he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sketch out a good imitation of printed numbers and the name that Petra Cotes thought good to call </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">165 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the business: Divine Providence Raffles. But with time he felt so tired after drawing up to two thousand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tickets a week that he had the animals, the name, and the numbers put on rubber stamps, and then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the work was reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors. In his last years it occurred to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him to substitute riddles for the numbers so that the prize could be shared by all of those who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">guessed it, but the system turned out to be so complicated and was open to so much suspicion that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he gave it up after the second attempt. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo was so busy trying to maintain the prestige of his raffles that he barely had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time to see the children. Fernanda put Amaranta Ursula in a small private school where they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">admitted only six girls, but she refused to allow Aureliano to go to public school. She considered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she had already relented too much in letting him leave the room. Besides, the schools in those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days accepted only the legitimate offspring of Catholic marriages and on the birth certificate that had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been pinned to Aureliano&rsquo;s clothing when they brought him to the house he was registered as a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foundling. So he remained shut In at the mercy of Santa Sofia de la Piedad&rsquo;s loving eyes and Ursula&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mental quirks, learning in the narrow world of the house whatever Iris grandmothers explained to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him. He was delicate, thin, with a curiosity that unnerved the adults, but unlike the inquisitive and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sometimes clairvoyant look that the colonel had at his age, his look was blinking and somewhat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distracted. While Amaranta Ursula was in kindergarten, he would hunt earthworms and torture </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insects in the garden. But once when Fernanda caught him putting scorpions in a box to put in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula&rsquo;s bed, she locked him up in Meme&rsquo;s old room, where he spent his solitary hours looking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the pictures in the encyclopedia. Ursula found him there one afternoon when she was going </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about sprinkling the house with distilled water and a bunch of nettles, and in spite of the fact that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had been with him many times she asked him who he was. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Aureliano Buendia,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s time for you to start learning how to be a silversmith.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had confused him with her son again, because the hot wind that came after the deluge and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had brought occasional waves of lucidity to Ursula&rsquo;s brain had passed. She never got her reason </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back. When she went into the bedroom she found Petronila Iguaran there with the bothersome </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crinolines and the beaded jacket that she put on for formal visits, and she found Tranquilina Maria </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miniata Alacoque Buendia, her grandmother, fanning herself with a peacock feather in her invalid&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rocking chair, and her great-grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendia, with his imitation dolman of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the viceregal guard, and Aureliano Iguaran, her father, who had invented a prayer to make the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worms shrivel up and drop off cows, and her timid mother, and her cousin with the pig&rsquo;s tail, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio Buendia, and her dead sons, all sitting in chairs lined up against the wall as if it were a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wake and not a visit. She was tying a colorful string of chatter together, commenting on things from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many separate places and many different times, so that when Amaranta Ursula returned from school </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find her sitting on her bed, talking to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">herself and lost in a labyrinth of dead people. &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; she shouted once in terror and for an instant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">panic spread through the house, but what she was telling about was the burning of a barn that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had witnessed when she was four years old. She finally mixed up the past with the present in such a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">way that in the two or three waves of lucidity that she had before she died, no one knew for certain </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whether she was speaking about what she felt or what she remembered. Little by little she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shrinking, turning into a fetus, becoming mummified in life to the point that in her last months she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a cherry raisin lost inside of her nightgown, and the arm that she always kept raised looked like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the paw of a marimonda monkey. She was motionless for several days, and Santa Sofia de la Piedad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had to shake her to convince herself that she was alive and sat her on her lap to feed her a few </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spoonfuls of sugar water. She looked like a newborn old woman. Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would take her in and out of the bedroom, they would lay her on the altar to see if she was any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">larger than the Christ child, and one afternoon they hid her in a closet in the Pantry where the rats </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">166 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could have eaten her. One Palm Sunday they went into the bedroom while Fernanda was in church </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and carried Ursula out by the neck and ankles. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Poor great-great-grandmother,&rdquo; Amaranta Ursula said. &ldquo;She died of old age.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was startled. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pm alive!&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can see.&rdquo; Amaranta Ursula said, suppressing her laughter, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s not even breathing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pm talking!&rdquo; Ursula shouted. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t even talk,&rdquo; Aureliano said. &ldquo;She died like a little cricket.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Ursula gave in to the evidence. &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; she exclaimed in a low voice. &ldquo;So this is what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s like to be dead.&rdquo; She started an endless, stumbling, deep prayer that lasted more than two days, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and that by Tuesday had degenerated into a hodgepodge of requests to God and bits of practical </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">advice to stop the red ants from bringing the house down, to keep the lamp burning by Remedios&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">daguerreotype, and never to let any Buendia marry a person of the same blood because their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children would be born with the tail of a pig. Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">delirium to get her to ten him where the gold was buried, but his entreaties were useless once more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When the owner appears,&rdquo; Ursula said, &ldquo;God will illuminate him so that he will find it.&rdquo; Santa Sofia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">de la Piedad had the certainty that they would find her dead from one moment to the next, because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she noticed during those days a certain confusion in nature: the roses smelled like goosefoot, a pod </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of chick peas fell down and the beans lay on the ground in a perfect geometrical pattern in the shape </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a starfish and one night she saw a row of luminous orange disks pass across the sky. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They found her dead on the morning of Good Friday. The last time that they had helped her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">calculate her age, during the time of the banana company, she had estimated it as between one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty-two. They buried her in a coffin that was not much larger </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">than the basket in which Aureliano had arrived, and very few people were at the funeral, partly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because there wet not many left who remembered her, and partly because it was so hot that noon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the birds in their confusion were running into walls like day pigeons and breaking through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">screens to die in the bedrooms. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first they thought it was a plague. Housewives were exhausted from sweeping away so many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dead birds, especially at siesta time, and the men dumped them into the river by the cartload. On </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Easter Sunday the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isabel stated from the pulpit that the death of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the birds was due to the evil influence of the Wandering Jew, whom he himself had seen the night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">before. He described him as a cross between a billy goat and a female heretic, an infernal beast </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whose breath scorched the air and whose look brought on the birth of monsters in newlywed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">women. There were not many who paid attention to his apocalyptic talk, for the town was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced that the priest was rambling because of his age. But one woman woke everybody up at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dawn on Wednesday because she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof. They were so clear </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and unmistakable that those who went to look at them had no doubt about the existence of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fearsome creature similar to the one described by the parish priest and they got together to set traps </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in their courtyards. That was how they managed to capture it. Two weeks after Ursula&rsquo;s death, Petra </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cotes and Aureliano Segundo woke up frightened by the especially loud bellowing of a calf that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">coming from nearby. When they got there a group of men were already pulling the monster off the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sharpened stakes they had set in the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves, and it stopped lowing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as heavy as an ox in spite of the fact that it was no taller than a young steer, and a green and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">greasy liquid flowed from its wounds. Its body was covered with rough hair, plagued with small </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ticks, and the skin was hardened with the scales of a remora fish, but unlike the priest&rsquo;s description, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">its human parts were more like those of a sickly angel than of a man, for its hands were tense and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">agile, its eyes large and gloomy, and on its shoulder blades it had the scarred-over and calloused </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stumps of powerful wings which must have been chopped off by a woodsman&rsquo;s ax. They hung it to </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">167 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an almond tree in the square by its ankles so that everyone could see it, and when it began to rot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they burned it in a bonfire, for they could not determine whether its bastard nature was that of an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">animal to be thrown into the river or a human being to be buried. It was never established whether </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it had really caused the death of the birds, but the newly married women did not bear the predicted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">monsters, nor did the intensity of the heat decrease. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rebeca died at the end of that year. Argenida, her lifelong servant, asked the authorities for help </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to knock down the door to the bedroom where her mistress had been locked in for three days, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they found her, on her solitary bed, curled up like a shrimp, with her head bald from ringworm and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her finger in her mouth. Aureliano Segundo took charge of the funeral and tried to restore the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in order to sell it, but the destruction was so far advanced in it that the walls became scaly as soon as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they were painted and there was not enough mortar to stop the weeds from cracking the floors and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the ivy from rotting the beams. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how everything went after the deluge. The indolence of the people was in contrast to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the voracity of oblivion, which little by little was undermining memories in a pitiless way, to such an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">extreme that at that time, on another anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia, some emissaries from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the president of the republic arrived in Macondo to award at last the decoration rejected several </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">times by Colonel Aureliano Buendfa, and they spent a whole afternoon looking for someone who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could tell them where they could find one of his descendants. Aureliano Segundo was tempted to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accept it, thinking that it was a medal of solid gold, but Petra Cotes convinced him that it was not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proper when the emissaries already had some proclamations and speeches ready for the ceremony. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was also around that time that the gypsies returned, the last heirs to Melqufades&rsquo; science, and they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found the town so defeated and its inhabitants so removed from the rest of the world that once </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more they went through the houses dragging magnetized ingots as if that really were the Babylonian </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wise men&rsquo;s latest discovery, and once again they concentrated the sun&rsquo;s rays with the giant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">magnifying glass, and there was no lack of people standing open-mouthed watching kettles fall and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pots roll and who paid fifty cents to be startled as a gypsy woman put in her false teeth and took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them out again. A broken-down yellow train that neither brought anyone in nor took anyone out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and that scarcely paused at the deserted station was the only thing that was left of the long train to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which Mr. Brown would couple his glass-topped coach with the episcopal lounging chairs and of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fruit trains with one hundred twenty cars which took a whole afternoon to pass by. The ecclesiastical </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">delegates who had come to investigate the report of the strange death of the birds and the sacrifice </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man&rsquo;s buff with the children, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thinking that Inis report was the product of a hallucination, they took him off to an asylum. A short </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time later they sent Father Augusto Angel, a crusader of the new breed, intransigent, audacious, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">daring, who personally rang the bells several times a day so that the peoples spirits would not get </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drowsy, and who went from house to house waking up the sleepers to go to mass but before a year </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was out he too was conquered by the negligence that one breathed in with the air, by the hot dust </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that made everything old and clogged up, and by the drowsiness caused by lunchtime meatballs in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the unbearable heat of siesta time. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Ursula&rsquo;s death the house again fell into a neglect from which it could not be rescued even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by a will as resolute and vigorous as that of Amaranta Ursula, who many years later, being a happy, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">modern woman without prejudices, with her feet on the ground, opened doors and windows in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">order to drive away the rain, restored the garden, exterminated the red ants who were already </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">walking across the porch in broad daylight, and tried in vain to reawaken the forgotten spirit of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hospitality. Fernanda&rsquo;s cloistered passion built in impenetrable dike against Ursula&rsquo;s torrential </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred years. Not only did she refuse to open doors when the arid wind passed through, but she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had the windows nailed shut with boards in the shape of a cross, obeying the paternal order of being </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">buried alive. The expensive correspondence with the invisible doctors ended in failure. After </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">168 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">numerous postponements, she shut herself up in her room on the date and hour agreed upon, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">covered only by a white sheet and with her head pointed north, and at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she felt that they were covering her head with a handkerchief soaked in a glacial liquid. When she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woke up the sun was shining in the window and she had a barbarous stitch in the shape of an arc </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that began at her crotch and ended at her sternum. But before she could complete the prescribed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rest she received a disturbed letter from the invisible doctors, who mid they had inspected her for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">six hours without finding anything that corresponded to the symptoms so many times and so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scrupulously described by her. Actually, her pernicious habit of not calling things by their names had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought about a new confusion, for the only thing that the telepathic surgeons had found was a drop </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the uterus which could be corrected by the use of a pessary. The disillusioned Fernanda tried to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">obtain more precise information, but the unknown correspondents did not answer her letters any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more. She felt so defeated by the weight of an unknown word that she decided to put shame behind </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her and ask what a pessary was, and only then did she discover that the French doctor had hanged </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">himself to a beam three months earlier and had been buried against the wishes of the townspeople </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by a former companion in arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. Then she confided in her son Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio and the latter sent her the pessaries from Rome along with a pamphlet explaining their use, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which she flushed down the toilet after committing it to memory so that no one would learn the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nature of her troubles. It was a useless precaution because the only people who lived in the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scarcely paid any attention to her. Santa Sofia de la Piedad was wandering about in her solitary old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">age, cooking the little that they ate and almost completely dedicated to the care of Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo. Amaranta Ursula, who had inherited certain attractions of Remedios the Beauty, spent the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time that she had formerly wasted tormenting Ursula at her schoolwork, and she began to show </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">good judgment and a dedication to study that brought back to Aureliano Segundo the high hopes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Meme had inspired in him. He had promised her to send her to finish her studies in Bmssels, in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accord with a custom established during the time of the banana company, and that illusion had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought him to attempt to revive the lands devastated by the deluge. The few times that he appeared </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at the house were for Amaranta Ursula, because with time he had become a stranger to Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and little Aureliano was becoming withdrawn as he approached puberty. Aureliano Segundo had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">faith that Fernanda&rsquo;s heart would soften with old age so that the child could join in the life of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">town where no one certainly would make any effort to speculate suspiciously about his origins. But </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano himself seemed to prefer the cloister of solitude and he did not show the least desire to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">know the world that began at the street door of the house. When Ursula had the door of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades&rsquo; room opened he began to linger about it, peeping through the half-opened door, and no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one knew at what moment he became close to Jose Arcadio Segundo in a link of mutual affection. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo discovered that friendship a long time after it had begun, when he heard the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">child talking about the killing at the station. It happened once when someone at the table </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">complained about the ruin into which the town had sunk when the banana company had abandoned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it, and Aureliano contradicted him with maturity and with the vision of a grown person. His point of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">view, contrary to the general interpretation, was that Macondo had been a prosperous place and well </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on its way until it was disordered and cormpted and suppressed by the banana company, whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">engineers brought on the deluge as a pretext to avoid promises made to the workers. Speaking with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">such good sense that to Fernanda he was like a sacrilegious parody of Jews among the wise men, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">child described with precise and convincing details how the army had macliine-gunned more than </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">three thousand workers penned up by the station and how they loaded the bodies onto a two- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred-car train and threw them into the sea. Convinced as most people were by the official </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">version that nothing had happened, Fernanda was scandalized with the idea that the child had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inherited the anarchist ideas of Colonel Aureliano Buendia and told him to be quiet. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo, on the other hand, recognized his twin brother&rsquo;s version. Actually, in spite of the fact that </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">169 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everyone considered him mad, Jose Arcadio Segundo was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house. He taught little Aureliano how to read and write, initiated him in the study of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parchments, and he inculcated him with such a personal interpretation of what the banana company </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had meant to Macondo that many years later, when Aureliano became part of the world, one would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have thought that he was telling a hallucinated version, because it was radically opposed to the false </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one that historians had created and consecrated in the schoolbooks. In the small isolated room </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where the arid air never penetrated, nor the dust, nor the heat, both had the atavistic vision of an old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man, his back to the window, wearing a hat with a brim like the wings of a crow who spoke about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the world many years before they had been born. Both described at the same time how it was always </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">March there and always Monday, and then they understood that Jose Arcadio Buendia was not as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crazy as the family said, but that he was the only one who had enough lucidity to sense the tmth of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the fact that time also stumbled and had accidents and could therefore splinter and leave an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eternalized fragment in a room. Jose Arcadio Segundo had managed, furthermore, to classify the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cryptic letters of the parchments. He was certain that they corresponded to an alphabet of forty- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seven to fifty-three characters, which when separated looked like scratching and scribbling, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which in the fine hand of Melquiades looked like pieces of clothing put out to dry on a line. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano remembered having seen a similar table in the English encyclopedia, so he brought it to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the room to compare it with that of Jose Arcadio Segundo. They were indeed the same. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around the time of the riddle lottery, Aureliano Segundo began waking up with a knot in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">throat, as if he were repressing a desire to weep. Petra Cotes interpreted it as one more of so many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">upsets brought on by the bad situation, and every morning for over a year she would touch his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">palate with a dash of honey and give him some radish syrup. When the knot in his throat became so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">oppressive that it was difficult for him to breathe, Aureliano Segundo visited Pilar Ternera to see if </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she knew of some herb that would give him relief. The dauntless grandmother, who had reached a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hundred years of age managing a small, clandestine brothel, did not tmst therapeutic superstitions, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so she turned the matter over to her cards. She saw the queen of diamonds with her throat wounded </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the steel of the jack of spades, and she deduced that Fernanda was trying to get her husband back </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">home by means of the discredited method of sticking pins into his picture but that she had brought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on an internal tumor because of her clumsy knowledge of the black arts. Since Aureliano Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had no other pictures except those of his wedding and the copies were all in the family album, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kept searching all through the house when his wife was not looking, and finally, in the bottom of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dresser, he came across a half-dozen pessaries in their original boxes. Thinking that the small red </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rubber rings were objects of witchcraft he put them in his pocket so that Pilar Ternera could have a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">look at them. She could not determine their nature, but they looked so suspicious to her that in any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">case she burned them in a bonfire she built in the courtyard. In order to conjure away Fernanda&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">alleged curse, she told Aureliano Segundo that he should soak a broody hen and bury her alive under </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the chestnut tree, and he did it with such good faith that when he finished hiding the turned-up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">earth with dried leaves he already felt that he was breathing better. For her part, Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interpreted the disappearance as a reprisal by the invisible doctors and she sewed a pocket of casing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the inside of her camisole where she kept the new pessaries that her son sent her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Six months after he had buried the hen, Aureliano Segundo woke up at midnight with an attack </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of coughing and the feeling that he was being strangled within by the claws of a crab. It was then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he understood that for all of the magical pessaries that he destroyed and all the conjuring hens </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he soaked, the single and sad piece of truth was that he was dying. He did not tell anyone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tormented by the fear of dying without having sent Amaranta Ursula to Bmssels, he worked as he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had never done, and instead of one he made three weekly raffles. From very early in the morning he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could be seen going through the town, even in the most outlying and miserable sections, trying to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sell tickets with an anxiety that could only be conceivable in a dying man. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Divine </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">170 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Providence,&rdquo; he hawked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it get away, because it only comes every hundred years.&rdquo; He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made pitiful efforts to appear gay, pleasant, talkative, but it was enough to see his sweat and paleness </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to know that his heart was not in it. Sometimes he would go to vacant lots, where no one could see </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him, and sit down to rest from the claws that were tearing him apart inside. Even at midnight he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be in the red-light district trying to console with predictions of good luck the lonely women </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who were weeping beside their phonographs. &ldquo;This number hasn&rsquo;t come up in four months,&rdquo; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">told them, showing them the tickets. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it get away, life is shorter than you think.&rdquo; They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finally lost respect for him, made fun of him, and in his last months they no longer called him Don </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, as they had always done, but they called him Mr. Divine Providence right to his face. His </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">voice was becoming filled with wrong notes. It was getting out of tune, and it finally diminished into </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the growl of a dog, but he still had the drive to see that there should be no diminishing of the hope </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people brought to Petra Cates&rsquo;s courtyard. As he lost his voice, however, and realized that in a short </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time he would be unable to bear the pain, he began to understand that it was not through raffled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived the idea of organizing the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fabulous raffle of the lands destroyed by the deluge, which could easily be restored by a person with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the money to do so. It was such a spectacular undertaking that the mayor himself lent his aid by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">announcing it in a proclamation, and associations were formed to buy tickets at one hundred pesos </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">apiece and they were sold out in less than a week. The night of the raffle the winners held a huge </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">celebration, comparable only to those of the good days of the banana company, and Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo, for the last time, played the forgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he could no longer sing them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two months later Amaranta Ursula went to Bmssels. Aureliano Segundo gave her not only the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">money from the special raffle, but also what he had managed to put aside over the previous months </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and what little he had received from the sale of the pianola, the clavichord, and other junk that had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fallen into disrepair. According to his calculations, that sum would be enough for her studies, so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that all that was la clang was the price of her fare back home. Fernanda was against the trip until the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">last moment, scandalized by the idea that Brussels was so close to Paris and its perdition, but she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">calmed down with the letter that Father Angel gave her addressed to a boardinghouse run by nuns </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for Catholic young ladies where Amaranta Ursula promised to stay until her studies were completed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Furthermore, the parish priest arranged for her to travel under the care of a group of Franciscan </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find dependable people to accompany her to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Belgium. While the urgent correspondence that made the coordination possible went forward, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Segundo, aided by Petra Cates, prepared Amaranta Ursula&rsquo;s baggage. The night on which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they were packing one of Fernanda&rsquo;s bridal trunks, the things were so well organized that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">schoolgirl knew by heart which were the suits and cloth slippers she could wear crossing the Atlantic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the blue cloth coat with copper buttons and the cordovan shoes she would wear when she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">landed. She also knew how to walk so as not to fall into the water as she went up the gangplank, that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at no time was she to leave the company of the nuns or leave her cabin except to eat, and that for no </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reason was she to answer the questions asked by people of any sex while they were at sea. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness and a notebook written by Father Angel in his own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hand containing six prayers to be used against storms. Fernanda made her a canvas belt to keep her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">money in, and she would not have to take it off even to sleep. She tried to give her the chamberpot, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">washed out with lye and disinfected with alcohol, but Amaranta Ursula refused it for fear that her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">schoolmates would make fun of her. A few months later, at the hour of his death, Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Segundo would remember her as he had seen her for the last time as she tried unsuccessfully to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lower the window of the second-class coach to hear Fernanda&rsquo;s last piece of advice. She was wearing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a pink silk dress with a corsage of artificial pansies pinned to her left shoulder, her cordovan shoes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with buckles and low heels, and sateen stockings held up at the thighs with elastic garters. Her body </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">171 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was slim, her hair loose and long, and she had the lively eyes that Ursula had had at her age and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">way in which she said good-bye, without crying but without smiling either, revealed the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strength of character. Walking beside the coach as it picked up speed and holding Fernanda by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arm so that she would not stumble, Aureliano scarcely had time to wave at his daughter as she threw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him a kiss with the tips of her fingers. The couple stood motionless under the scorching sun, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looking at the train as it merged with the black strip of the horizon, linking arms for the first time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since the day of their wedding. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the ninth of August, before they received the first letter from Brussels, Jose Arcadio Segundo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was speaking to Aureliano in Melquiades&rsquo; room and, without realizing it, he said: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Always remember that they were more than three thousand and that they were thrown into the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sea.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he fell back on the parchments and died with his eyes open. At that same instant, in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda&rsquo;s bed, his twin brother came to the end of the prolonged and terrible martyrdom of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">steel crabs that were eating his throat away. One week previously he had returned home, without any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">voice, unable to breathe, and almost skin and bones, with his wandering trunks and his wastrel&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accordion, to fulfill the promise of dying beside his wife. Petra Cotes helped him pack his clothes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and bade him farewell without shedding a tear, but she forgot to give him the patent leather shoes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he wanted to wear in his coffin. So when she heard that he had died, she dressed in black, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrapped the shoes up in a newspaper, and asked Fernanda for permission to see the body. Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would not let her through the door. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Put yourself in my place,&rdquo; Petra Cotes begged. &ldquo;Imagine how much I must have loved him to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put up with this humiliation.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no humiliation that a concubine does not deserve,&rdquo; Fernanda replied. &ldquo;So wait until </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">another one of your men dies and put the shoes on him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fulfillment of her promise, Santa Sofia de la Piedad cut the throat of Jose Arcadio Segundo&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">corpse with a kitchen knife to be sure that they would not bury him alive. The bodies were placed in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">identical coffins, and then it could be seen that once more in death they had become as Identical as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they had been until adolescence. Aureliano Segundo&rsquo;s old carousing comrades laid on his casket a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wreath that had a purple ribbon with the words: Cease, coivs, life is short. Fernanda was so indignant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with such irreverence that she had the wreath thrown onto the trash heap. In the tumult of the last </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment, the sad drunkards who carried them out of the house got the coffins mixed up and buried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them in the wrong graves. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">172 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 18 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">AURELIANO DID NOT leave Melquiades&rsquo; room for a long time. He learned by heart the fantastic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">legends of the crumbling books, the synthesis of the studies of Hermann the Cripple, the notes on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the science of demonology, the keys to the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, the Centuries of Nostradamus and his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">research concerning the plague, so that he reached adolescence without knowing a tiling about his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">own time but with the basic knowledge of a medieval man. Any time that Santa Sofia de la Piedad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would go into his room she would find him absorbed in his reading. At dawn she would bring him a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mug of coffee without sugar and at noon a plate of rice and slices of fried plantain, which were the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only things eaten in the house since the death of Aureliano Segundo. She saw that his hair was cut, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">picked off the nits, took in to his size the old clothing that she found in forgotten tmnks, and when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his mustache began to appear the brought him Colonel Aureliano Buendia&rsquo;s razor and the small </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gourd he had used as a shaving mug. None of the latter&rsquo;s children had looked so much like him, not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even Aureliano Jose, particularly in respect to the prominent cheekbones and the firm and rather </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pitiless line of the lips. As had happened to Ursula with Aureliano Segundo when the latter was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">studying in the room, Santa Sofia de la Piedad thought that Aureliano was talking to himself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, he was talking to Melquiades. One burning noon, a short time after the death of the twins, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">against the light of the window he saw the gloomy old man with his crow&rsquo;s-wing hat like the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">materialization of a memory that had been in his head since long before he was born. Aureliano had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finished classifying the alphabet of the parchments, so that when Melquiades asked him if he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">discovered the language in which they had been written he did not hesitate to answer. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sanskrit,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades revealed to him that his opportunities to return to the room were limited. But he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would go in peace to the meadows of the ultimate death because Aureliano would have time to learn </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sanskrit during the years remaining until the parchments became one hundred years old, when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could be deciphered. It was he who indicated to Aureliano that on the narrow street going down to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the river, where dreams had been interpreted during the time of the banana company, a wise </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Catalonian had a bookstore where there was a Sanskrit primer, which would be eaten by the moths </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">within six years if he did not hurry to buy it. For the first time in her long life Santa Sofia de la </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Piedad let a feeling show through, and it was a feeling of wonderment when Aureliano asked her to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bring him the book that could be found between Jerusalem Delivered and Milton&rsquo;s poems on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">extreme right-hand side of the second shelf of the bookcases. Since she could not read, she memo&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rized what he had said and got some money by selling one of the seventeen little gold fishes left in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the workshop, the whereabouts of which, after being hidden the night the soldiers searched the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house, was known only by her and Aureliano. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano made progress in his studies of Sanskrit as Melquiades&rsquo; visits became less and less </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frequent and he was more distant, fading away in the radiant light of noon. The last time that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano sensed him he was only an invisible presence who murmured: &ldquo;I died of fever on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sands of Singapore.&rdquo; The room then became vulnerable to dust, heat, termites, red ants, and moths, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who would turn the wisdom of the parchments into sawdust. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no shortage of food in the house. The day after the death of Aureliano Segundo, one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the friends who had brought the wreath with the irreverent inscription offered to pay Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">some money that he had owed her husband. After that every Wednesday a delivery boy brought a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">basket of food that was quite sufficient for a week. No one ever knew that those provisions were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being sent by Petra Cotes with the idea that the continuing charity was a way of humiliating the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">person who had humiliated her. Nevertheless, the rancor disappeared much sooner than she herself </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">173 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had expected, and then she continued sending the food out of pride and finally out of compassion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Several times, when she had no animals to raffle off and people lost interest in the lottery, she went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without food so that Fernanda could have something to eat, and she continued fulfilling the pledge </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to herself until she saw Fernanda&rsquo;s funeral procession pass by. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Santa Sofia de la Piedad the reduction in the number of inhabitants of the house should have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">meant the rest she deserved after more than half a century of work. Never a lament had been heard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from that stealthy, impenetrable woman who had sown in the family the angelic seed of Remedios </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Beauty and the mysterious solemnity of Jose Arcadio Segundo; who dedicated a whole life of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitude and diligence to the rearing of children although she could barely remember whether they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were her children or grandchildren, and who took care of Aureliano as if he had come out of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">womb, not knowing herself that she was his great-grandmother. Only in a house like that was it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conceivable for her always to sleep on a mat she laid out on the pantry floor in the midst of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nocturnal noise of the rats, and without telling anyone that one night she had awakened with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frightened feeling that someone was looking at her in the darkness and that it was a poisonous snake </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crawling over her stomach. She knew that if she had told Ursula, the latter would have made her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sleep in her own bed, but those were times when no one was aware of anything unless it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shouted on the porch, because with the bustle of the bakery, the surprises of the war, the care of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children, there was not much room for thinking about other peoples happiness. Petra Cotes whom </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had never seen, was the only one who remembered her. She saw to it that she had a good pair of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shoes for street wear, that she always had clothing, even during the times when the raffles were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">working only through some miracle. When Fernanda arrived at the house she had good reason to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">think that she was an ageless servant, and even though she heard it said several times that she was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her husband&rsquo;s mother it was so incredible that it took her longer to discover it than to forget it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Santa Sofia de la Piedad never seemed bothered by that lowly position. On the contrary, one had the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impression that she liked to stay in the corners, without a pause, without a complaint, keeping clean </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and in order the immense house that she had lived in ever since adolescence and that, especially </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">during the time of the banana company, was more like a barracks than a home. But when Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">died the superhuman diligence of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, her tremendous capacity for work, began </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to fall apart. It was not only that she was old and exhausted, but overnight the house had plunged </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a crisis of senility. A soft moss grew up the walls. When there was no longer a bare spot in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard, the weeds broke through the cement of the porch, breaking it like glass, and out of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cracks grew the same yellow flowers that Ursula had found in the glass with Melquiades&rsquo; false teeth a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">century before. With neither the time nor the resources to halt the challenge of nature, Santa Sofia </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">de la Piedad spent the day in the bedrooms driving out the lizards who would return at night. One </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morning she saw that the red ants had left the undermined foundations, crossed the garden, climbed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up the railing, where the begonias had taken on an earthen color, and had penetrated into the heart </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the house. She first tried to kill them with a broom, then with insecticides, and finally with lye, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the next day they were back in the same place, still passing by, tenacious and invincible. Fernanda, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">writing letters to her children, was not aware of the unchecked destructive attack. Santa Sofia de la </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Piedad continued struggling alone, fighting the weeds to stop them from getting into the kitchen, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pulling from the walls the tassels of spider webs which were rebuilt in a few hours, scraping off the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">termites. But when she saw that Melquiades&rsquo; room was also dusty and filled with cobwebs even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">though she swept and dusted three times a day, and that in spite of her furious cleaning it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">threatened by the debris and the air of misery that had been foreseen only by Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendia and the young officer, she realized that she was defeated. Then she put on her worn Sunday </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dress, some old shoes of Ursula&rsquo;s, and a pair of cotton stockings that Amaranta Ursula had given </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her, and she made a bundle out of the two or three changes of clothing that she had left. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I give up,&rdquo; she said to Aureliano. &ldquo;This is too much house for my poor bones.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">174 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano asked her where she was going and she made a vague sign, as if she did not have the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">slightest idea of her destination. She tried to be more precise, however, saying that she was going to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spend her last years with a first cousin who lived in Riohacha. It was not a likely explanation. Since </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the death of her parents she had not had contact with anyone in town or received letters or </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">messages, nor had she been heard to speak of any relatives. Aureliano gave her fourteen little gold </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fishes because she was determined to leave with only what she had: one peso and twenty-five cents. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the window of the room he saw her cross the courtyard with her bundle of clothing, dragging </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her feet and bent over by her years, and he saw her reach her hand through an opening in the main </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">door and replace the bar after she had gone out. Nothing was ever heard of her again. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she heard about the flight, Fernanda ranted for a whole day as she checked trunks, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dressers, and closets, item by item, to make sure that Santa Sofia de la Piedad had not made off with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anything. She burned her fingers trying to light a fire for the first time in her life and she had to ask </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano to do her the favor of showing her how to make coffee. Fernanda would find her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">breakfast ready when she arose and she would leave her room again only to get the meal that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano had left covered on the embers for her, which she would carry to the table to eat on linen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tablecloths and between candelabra, sitting at the solitary head of the table facing fifteen empty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chairs. Even under those circumstances Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their solitude, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">both continued living on their own, cleaning their respective rooms while the cobwebs fell like snow </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the rose bushes, carpeted the beams, cushioned the walls. It was around that time that Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">got the impression that the house was filling up with elves. It was as if things, especially those for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everyday use, had developed a faculty for changing location on their own. Fernanda would waste </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time looking for the shears that she was sure she had put on the bed and after turning everything </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">upside down she would find them on a shelf in the kitchen, where she thought she had not been for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">four days. Suddenly there was no fork in the silver chest and she would find six on the altar and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">three in the washroom. That wandering about of things was even more exasperating when she sat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down to write. The inkwell that she had placed at her right would be on the left, the blotter would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">be lost and she would find it two days later under her pillow, and the pages written to Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would get mixed up with those written to Amaranta Ursula, and she always had the feeling of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mortification that she had put the letters in opposite envelopes, as in fact happened several times. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On one occasion she lost her fountain pen. Two weeks later the mailman, who had found it in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bag, returned it. He had been going from house to house looking for its owner. At first she thought </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it was some business of the invisible doctors, like the disappearance of the pessaries, and she even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">started a letter to them begging them to leave her alone, but she had to interrupt it to do something </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and when she went back to her room she not only did not find the letter she had started but she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">forgotten the reason for writing it. For a time she thought it was Aureliano. She began to spy on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him, to put things in his path trying to catch him when he changed their location, but she was soon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">convinced that Aureliano never left Melquiades&rsquo; room except to go to the kitchen or the toilet, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he was not a man to play tricks. So in the end she believed that it was the mischief of elves and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she decided to secure everything in the place where she would use it. She tied the shears to the head </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of her bed with a long string. She tied the pen and the blotter to the leg of the table, and the glued </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the inkwell to the top of it to the right of the place where she normally wrote. The problems were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not solved overnight, because a few hours after she had tied the string to the shears it was not long </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough for her to cut with, as if the elves had shortened it. The same tiling happened to her with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">string to the pen and even with her own arm which after a short time of writing could not reach the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inkwell. Neither Amaranta Ursula in Brussels nor Jose Arcadio in Rome ever heard about those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insignificant misfortunes. Fernanda told them that she was happy and in reality she was, precisely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because she felt free from any compromise, as if life were pulling her once more toward the world </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of her parents, where one did not suffer with day-to-day problems because they were solved </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">175 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beforehand in one&rsquo;s imagination. That endless correspondence made her lose her sense of time, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">especially after Santa Sofia de la Piedad had left. She had been accustomed to keep track of the days, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months, and years, using as points of reference the dates set for the return of her children. But when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they changed their plans time and time again, the dates became confused, the periods were mislaid, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and one day seemed so much like another that one could not feel them pass. Instead of becoming </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">impatient, she felt a deep pleasure in the delay. It did not worry her that many years after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">announcing the eve of his final vows, Jose Arcadio was still saying that he was waiting to finish his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">studies in advanced theology in order to undertake those in diplomacy, because she understood how </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">steep and paved with obstacles was the spiral stairway that led to the throne of Saint Peter. On the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other hand, her spirits rose with news that would have been insignificant for other people, such as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the fact that her son had seen the Pope. She felt a similar pleasure when Amaranta Ursula wrote to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tell her that her studies would last longer than the time foreseen because her excellent grades had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">earned her privileges that her father had not taken into account in his calculations. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More than three years had passed since Santa Sofia de la Piedad had brought him the grammar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when Aureliano succeeded in translating the first sheet. It was not a useless chore, but it was only a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first step along a road whose length it was impossible to predict, because the text in Spanish did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mean anything: the lines were in code. Aureliano lacked the means to establish the keys that would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">permit him to dig them out, but since Melquiades had told him that the books he needed to get to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bottom of the parchments were in the wise Catalonian&rsquo;s store, he decided to speak to Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so that she would let him get them. In the room devoured by rubble, whose unchecked proliferation </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had finally defeated it, he thought about the best way to frame the request, but when he found </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda taking her meal from the embers, which was his only chance to speak to her, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laboriously formulated request stuck in his throat and he lost his voice. That was the only time that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he watched her. He listened to her steps in the bedroom. He heard her on her way to the door to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">await the letters from her children and to give hers to the mailman, and he listened until late at night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the harsh, impassioned scratching of her pen on the paper before hearing the sound of the light </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">switch and the murmur of her prayers in the darkness. Only then did he go to sleep, trusting that on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the following day the awaited opportunity would come. He became so inspired with the idea that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">permission would be granted that one morning he cut his hair, which at that time reached down to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his shoulders, shaved off his tangled beard, put on some tight-fitting pants and a shirt with an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">artificial collar that he had inherited from he did not know whom, and waited in the kitchen for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda to get her breakfast. The woman of every day, the one with her head held high and with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stony gait, did not arrive, but an old woman of supernatural beauty with a yellowed ermine cape, a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crown of gilded cardboard, and the languid look of a person who wept in secret. Actually, ever since </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she had found it in Aureliano Segundo&rsquo;s trunks, Fernanda had put on the moth-eaten queen&rsquo;s dress </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many times. Anyone who could have seen her in front of the mirror, in ecstasy over her own regal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gestures, would have had reason to think that she was mad. But she was not. She had simply turned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the royal regalia into a device for her memory. The first time that she put it on she could not help a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knot from forming in her heart and her eyes filling with tears because at that moment she smelled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">once more the odor of shoe polish on the boots of the officer who came to get her at her house to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">make her a queen, and her soul brightened with the nostalgia of her lost dreams. She felt so old, so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worn out, so far away from the best moments of her life that she even yearned for those that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remembered as the worst, and only then did she discover how much she missed the whiff of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">oregano on the porch and the smell of the roses at dusk, and even the bestial nature of the parvenus. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart of compressed ash, which had resisted the most telling blows of daily reality without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strain, fell apart with the first waves of nostalgia. The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">years eroded her. She became human in her solitude. Nevertheless, the morning on which she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">entered the kitchen and found a cup of coffee offered her by a pale and bony adolescent with a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">176 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hallucinated glow in his eyes, the claws of ridicule tore at her. Not only did she refuse him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">permission, but from then on she carried the keys to the house in the pocket where she kept the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unused pessaries. It was a useless precaution because if he had wanted to, Aureliano could have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">escaped and even returned to the house without being seen. But the prolonged captivity, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">uncertainty of the world, the habit of obedience had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart. So </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he went back to his enclosure, reading and rereading the parchments and listening until very late </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at night to Fernanda sobbing in her bedroom. One morning he went to light the fire as usual and on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the extinguished ashes he found the food that he had left for her the day before. Then he looked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into her bedroom and saw her lying on the bed covered with the ermine cape, more beautiful than </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ever and with her skin turned into an ivory casing. Four months later, when Jose Arcadio arrived, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found her intact. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was impossible to conceive of a man more like his mother. He was wearing a somber taffeta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suit, a shirt with a round and hard collar, and a thin silk ribbon tied in a bow in place of a necktie. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was ruddy and languid with a startled look and weak lips. His black hair, shiny and smooth, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parted in the middle of his head by a straight and tired line, had the same artificial appearance as the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hair on the saints. The shadow of a well-uprooted beard on his paraffin face looked like a question </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of conscience. His hands were pale, with green veins and fingers that were like parasites, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wore a solid gold ring with a round sunflower opal on his left index finger. When he opened the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">street door Aureliano did not have to be told who he was to realize that he came from far away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his steps the house filled up with the fragrance of the toilet water that Ursula used to splash on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him when he was a child in order to find him in the shadows, in some way impossible to ascertain, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">after so many years of absence. Jose Arcadio was still an autumnal child, terribly sad and solitary. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went directly to his mother&rsquo;s bedroom, where Aureliano had boiled mercury for four months in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grandfather&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s water pipe to conserve the body according to Melquiades&rsquo; formula. Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio did not ask him any questions. He kissed the corpse on the forehead and withdrew from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">under her skirt the pocket of casing which contained three as yet unused pessaries and the key to her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cabinet. He did everything with direct and decisive movements, in contrast to his languid look. From </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the cabinet he took a small damascene chest with the family crest and found on the inside, which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was perfumed with sandalwood, the long letter in which Fernanda unburdened her heart of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">numerous truths that she had hidden from him. He read it standing up, avidly but without anxiety, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and at the third page he stopped and examined Aureliano with a look of second recognition. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said with a voice with a touch of razor in it, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the bastard.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Aureliano Buendia.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go to your room,&rdquo; Jose Arcadio said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano went and did not come out again even from curiosity when he heard the sound of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitary funeral ceremonies. Sometimes, from the kitchen, he would see Jose Arcadio strolling </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the house, smothered by his anxious breathing, and he continued hearing his steps in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ruined bedrooms after midnight. He did not hear his voice for many months, not only because Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio never addressed him, but also because he had no desire for it to happen or time to think </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about anything else but the parchments. On Fernanda&rsquo;s death he had taken out the next-to-the-last </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">little fish and gone to the wise Catalonian&rsquo;s bookstore in search of the books he needed. Nothing he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saw along the way interested him, perhaps because he lacked any memories for comparison and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deserted streets and desolate houses were the same as he had imagined them at a time when he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would have given his soul to know them. He had given himself the permission denied by Fernanda </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and only once and for the minimum time necessary, so without pausing he went along the eleven </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">blocks that separated the house from the narrow street where dreams had been interpreted in other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">days and he went panting into the confused and gloomy place where there was barely room to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">move. More than a bookstore, it looked like a dump for used books, which were placed in disorder </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">177 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the shelves chewed by termites, in the comers sticky with cobwebs, and even in the spaces that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were supposed to serve as passageways. On a long table, also heaped with old books and papers, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">proprietor was writing tireless prose in purple letters, somewhat outlandish, and on the loose pages </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a school notebook. He had a handsome head of silver hair which fell down over his forehead like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the plume of a cockatoo, and his blue eyes, lively and close-set, revealed the gentleness of a man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who had read all of the books. He was wearing short pants and soaking in perspiration, and he did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not stop his writing to see who had come in. Aureliano had no difficulty in rescuing the five books </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he was looking for from that fabulous disorder, because they were exactly where Melquiades </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had told him they would be. Without saying a word he handed them, along with the little gold fish, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the wise Catalonian and the latter examined them, his eyelids contracting like two clams. &ldquo;You </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">must be mad,&rdquo; he said in his own language, shmgging his shoulders, and he handed back to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano the five books and the little fish. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can have them&rdquo; he said in Spanish. &ldquo;The last man who read these books must have been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaac the Blindman, so consider well what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose Arcadio restored Meme&rsquo;s bedroom and had the velvet curtains cleaned and mended along </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the damask on the canopy of the viceregal bed, and he put to use once more the abandoned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bathroom where the cement pool was blackened by a fibrous and rough coating. He restricted his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vest-pocket empire of worn, exotic clothing, false perfumes, and cheap jewelry to those places. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only thing that seemed to wort}? him in the rest of the house were the saints on the family altar, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which he burned down to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he lighted in the courtyard. He would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sleep until past eleven o&rsquo;clock. He would go to the bathroom in a shabby robe with golden dragons </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on it and a pair of slippers with yellow tassels, and there he would officiate at a rite which for its care </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and length recalled Remedios the Beauty. Before bathing he would perfume the pool with the salts </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he carried in three alabaster flacons. He did not bathe himself with the gourd but would plunge </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into the fragrant waters and remain there for two hours floating on his back, lulled by the coolness </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and by the memory of Amaranta. A few days after arriving he put aside his taffeta suit, which in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">addition to being too hot for the town was the only one that he had, and he exchanged it for some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tight-fitting pants very similar to those worn by Pietro Crespi during his dance lessons and a silk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shirt woven with thread from living caterpillars and with Inis initials embroidered over the heart. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Twice a week he would wash the complete change in the tub and would wear his robe until it dried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because he had nothing else to put on. He never ate at home. He would go out when the heat of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">siesta time had eased and would not return until well into the night. Then he would continue his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anxious pacing, breathing like a cat and thinking about Amaranta. She and the frightful look of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saints in the glow of the nocturnal lamp were the two memories he retained of the house. Many </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">times during the hallucinating Roman August he had opened his eyes in the middle of his sleep and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had seen Amaranta rising out of a marble-edged pool with her lace petticoats and the bandage on </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her hand, idealized by the anxiety of exile. Unlike Aureliano Jose who tried to drown that image in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bloody bog of war, he tried to keep it alive in the sink of concupiscence while he entertained his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mother with the endless fable of his pontifical vocation. It never occurred either to him or to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda to think that their correspondence was an exchange of fantasies. Jose Arcadio, who left </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the seminary as soon as he reached Rome, continued nourishing the legend of theology and canon </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">law so as not to jeopardize the fabulous inheritance of which his mother&rsquo;s delirious letters spoke and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which would rescue him from the misery and sordidness he shared with two friends in a Trastevere </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">garret. When he received Fernanda&rsquo;s last letter, dictated by the foreboding of imminent death, he put </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the leftovers of his false splendor into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in the hold of a ship where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">immigrants were crammed together like cattle in a slaughterhouse, eating cold macaroni and wormy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cheese. Before he read Fernanda&rsquo;s will, which was nothing but a detailed and tardy recapitulation of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her misfortunes, the broken-down furniture and the weeds on the porch had indicated that he had </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">178 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fallen into a trap from which he would never escape, exiled forever from the diamond light and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">timeless air of the Roman spring. During the cmshing insomnia brought on by his asthma he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">measure and remeasure the depth of his misfortune as he went through the shadowy house where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the senile fussing of Ursula had instilled a fear of the world in him. In order to be sure that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would not lose him in the shadows, she had assigned him a corner of the bedroom, the only one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where he would be safe from the dead people who wandered through the house after sundown. &ldquo;If </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you do anything bad,&rdquo; Ursula would tell him, &ldquo;the saints will let me know.&rdquo; The terror-filled nights </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of his childhood were reduced to that corner where he would remain motionless until it was time to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">go to bed, perspiring with fear on a stool under the watchful and glacial eyes of the tattletale saints. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was useless torture because even at that time he already had a terror of everything around him and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was prepared to be frightened at anything he met in life: women on the street, who would ruin </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his blood; the women in the house, who bore children with the tail of a pig; fighting cocks, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought on the death of men and remorse for the rest of one&rsquo;s life; firearms, which with the mere </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">touch would bring down twenty years of war; uncertain ventures, which led only to disillusionment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and madness&mdash;everything, in short, everything that God had created in His infinite goodness and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the devil had perverted. When he awakened, pressed in the vise of his nightmares, the light in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the window and the caresses of Amaranta in the bath and the pleasure of being powdered between </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the legs with a silk puff would release him from the terror. Even Ursula was different under the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">radiant light in the garden because there she did not talk about fearful things but would bmsh his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">teeth with charcoal powder so that he would have the radiant smile of a Pope, and she would cut </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and polish Inis nails so that the pilgrims who came to Rome from all over the world would be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">startled at the beauty of the Pope&rsquo;s hands as he blessed them, and she would comb his hair like that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a Pope, and she would sprinkle his body and his clothing with toilet water so that his body and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his clothes would have the fragrance of a Pope. In the courtyard of Castel Gandolfo he had seen the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pope on a balcony making the same speech in seven languages for a crowd of pilgrims and the only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thing, indeed, that had drawn his attention was the whiteness of his hands, which seemed to have </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been soaked in lye, the dazzling shine of his summer clothing, and the hidden breath of cologne. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost a year after his return home, having sold the silver candlesticks and the heraldic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chamberpot&mdash;which at the moment of truth turned out to have only a little gold plating on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crest&mdash;in order to eat, the only distraction of Jose Arcadio was to pick up children in town so that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they could play in the house. He would appear with them at siesta time and have them skip rope in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the garden, sing on the porch, and do acrobatics on the furniture in the living room while he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">go among the groups giving lessons in good manners. At that time he had finished with the tight </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pants and the silk shirts and was wearing an ordinary suit of clothing that he had bought in the Arab </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stores, but he still maintained his languid dignity and his papal air. The children took over the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">just as Meme&rsquo;s schoolmates had done in the past. Until well into the night they could be heard </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chattering and singing and tap-dancing, so that the house resembled a boarding school where there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was no discipline. Aureliano did not worry about the invasion as long as they did not bother him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melquiades&rsquo; room. One morning two children pushed open the door and were startled at the sight </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a filthy and hairy man who was still deciphering the parchments on the worktable. They did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dare go in, but they kept on watching the room. They would peep in through the cracks, whispering, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they threw live animals in through the transom, and on one occasion they nailed up the door and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">window and it took Aureliano half a day to force them open. Amused at their unpunished mischief, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">four of the children went into the room one morning while Aureliano was in the kitchen, preparing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to destroy the parchments. But as soon as they laid hands on the yellowed sheets an angelic force </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lifted them off the ground and held them suspended in the air until Aureliano returned and took the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parchments away from them. From then on they did not bother him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">179 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The four oldest children, who wore short pants in spite of the fact that they were on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">threshold of adolescence, busied themselves with Jose Arcadio&rsquo;s personal appearance. They would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arrive earlier than the others and spend the morning shaving him, giving him massages with hot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">towels, cutting and polishing the nails on his hands and feet, and perfuming him with toilet water. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On several occasions they would get into the pool to soap him from head to toe as he floated on his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back thinking about Amaranta. Then they would dry him, powder his body, and dress him. One of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the children, who had curly blond hair and eyes of pink glass like a rabbit, was accustomed to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sleeping in the house. The bonds that linked him to Jose Arcadio were so strong that he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accompany him in his asthmatic insomnia, without speaking, strolling through the house with him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the darkness. One night in the room where Ursula had slept they saw a yellow glow coming through </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the crumbling cement as if an underground sun had changed the floor of the room into a pane of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">glass. They did not have to turn on the light. It was sufficient to lift the broken slabs in the corner </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where Ursula&rsquo;s bed had always stood and where the glow was most intense to find the secret crypt </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Aureliano Segundo had worn himself out searching for during the delirium of Inis excavations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were the three canvas sacks closed with copper wire, and inside of them the seven thousand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two hundred fourteen pieces of eight, which continued glowing like embers in the darkness. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The discovery of the treasure was like a deflagration. Instead of returning to Rome with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sudden fortune, which had been Inis dream maturing in misery, Jose Arcadio converted the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a decadent paradise. He replaced the curtains and the canopy of the bed with new velvet, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had the bathroom floor covered with paving stones and the walls with tiles. The cupboard in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dining room was filled with fruit preserves, hams, and pickles, and the unused pantry was opened </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again for the storage of wines and liqueurs which Jose Arcadio himself brought from the railroad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">station in crates marked with his name. One night he and the four oldest children had a party&#39; that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lasted until dawn. At six in the morning they came out naked from the bedroom, drained the pool, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and filled it with champagne. They jumped in en masse, swimming like birds flying through a sky </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gilded with fragrant bubbles, while Jose Arcadio, floated on his back on the edge of the festivities, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remembering Amaranta with his eyes open. He remained that way, wrapped up in himself, thinking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about the bitterness of his equivocal pleasures until after the children had become tired and gone in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a troop to the bedroom, where they tore down the curtains to dry&#39; themselves, and in the disorder </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they broke the rock crystal mirror into four pieces and destroyed the canopy of the bed in the tumult </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of lying down. When Jose Arcadio came back from the bathroom, he found them sleeping in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">naked heap in the shipwrecked bedroom. Inflamed, not so much because of the damage as because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the disgust and pity that he felt for himself in the emptiness of the saturnalia, he armed himself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with an ecclesiastical cat-o-nine-tails that he kept in the bottom of his tmnk along with a hair-shirt </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and other instmments of mortification and penance, and drove the children out of the house, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">howling like a madman and whipping them without mercy as a person would not even have done to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a pack of coyotes. He was done in, with an attack of asthma that lasted for several days and that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave him the look of a man on his deathbed. On the third night of torture, overcome by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asphyxiation, he went to Aureliano&rsquo;s room to ask him the favor of buying some powders to inhale at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a nearby dmgstore. So it was that Aureliano, went out for a second time. He had to go only two </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">blocks to reach the small pharmacy with dusty windows and ceramic bottles with labels in Latin </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where a girl with the stealthy beauty of a serpent of the Nile gave him the medicine the name of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which Jose Arcadio had written down on a piece of paper. The second view of the deserted town, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">barely illuminated by the yellowish bulbs of the street lights, did not awaken in Aureliano any more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">curiosity than the first. Jose Arcadio, had come to think that he had mn away, when he reappeared, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">panting a little because of his haste, dragging legs that enclosure and lack of mobility had made weak </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and heavy. His indifference toward the world was so certain that a few days later Jose Arcadio </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">violated the promise he had made to his mother and left him free to go out whenever he wanted to. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">180 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have nothing to do outside,&rdquo; Aureliano answered him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He remained shut up, absorbed in the parchments, which he was slowly unraveling and whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">meaning, nevertheless, he was unable to interpret. Jose Arcadio would bring slices of ham to him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his room, sugared flowers which left a spring-like aftertaste in his mouth, and on two occasions a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">glass of fine wine. He was not interested in the parchments, which he thought of more as an esoteric </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pastime, but his attention was attracted by the rare wisdom and the inexplicable knowledge of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">world that his desolate kinsman had. He discovered then that he could understand written English </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and that between parchments he had gone from the first page to the last of the six volumes of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">encyclopedia as if it were a novel. At first he attributed to that the fact that Aureliano could speak </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about Rome as if he had lived there many years, but he soon became aware that he knew things that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were not in the encyclopedia, such as the price of items. &ldquo;Everything is known,&rdquo; was the only reply </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he received from Aureliano when he asked him where he had got that information from. Aureliano, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for his part, was surprised that Jose Arcadio when seen from close by was so different from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">image that he had formed of him when he saw him wandering through the house. He was capable of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laughing, of allowing himself from time to time a feeling of nostalgia for the past of the house, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of showing concern for the state of misery present in Melquiades&rsquo; room. That drawing closer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">together of two solitary people of the same blood was far from friendship, but it did allow them </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">both to bear up better under the unfathomable solitude that separated and united them at the same </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time. Jose Arcadio could then turn to Aureliano to untangle certain domestic problems that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">exasperated him. Aureliano, in turn, could sit and read on the porch, waiting for the letters from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta Ursula, which still arrived with the usual punctuality, and could use the bathroom, from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which Jose Arcadio had banished him when he arrived. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One hot dawn they both woke up in alarm at an urgent knocking on the street door. It was a dark </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">old man with large green eyes that gave his face a ghostly phosphorescence and with a cross of ashes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on his forehead. His clothing in tatters, his shoes cracked, the old knapsack on his shoulder his only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">luggage, he looked like a beggar, but his bearing had a dignity that was in frank contradiction to his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">appearance. It was only necessary to look at him once, even in the shadows of the parlor, to realize </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the secret strength that allowed him to live was not the instinct of self-preservation but the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">habit of fear. It was Aureliano Amador, the only survivor of Colonel Aureliano Buendia&rsquo;s seventeen </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sons, searching for a respite in his long and hazardous existence as a fugitive. He identified himself, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">begged them to give him refuge in that house which during his nights as a pariah he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remembered as the last redoubt of safety left for him in life. But Jose Arcadio and Aureliano did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remember him. Thinking that he was a tramp, they pushed him into the street. They both saw from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the doorway the end of a drama that had began before Jose Arcadio had reached the age of reason. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two policemen who had been chasing Aureliano Amador for years, who had tracked him like </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bloodhounds across half the world, came out from among the almond trees on the opposite </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sidewalk and took two shots with their Mausers which neatly penetrated the cross of ashes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ever since he had expelled the children from the house, Jose Arcadio was really waiting for news </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of an ocean liner that would leave for Naples before Christmas. He had told Aureliano and had even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made plans to set him up in a business that would bring him a living, because the baskets of food </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had stopped coming since Fernanda&rsquo;s burial. But that last dream would not be fulfilled either. One </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">September morning, after having coffee in the kitchen with Aureliano, Jose Arcadio was finishing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inis daily bath when through the openings in the tiles the four children he had expelled from the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house burst in. Without giving him time to defend himself, they jumped into the pool fully clothed, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grabbed him by the hair, and held his head under the water until the bubbling of his death throes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ceased on the surface and Inis silent and pale dolphin body dipped down to the bottom of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fragrant water. Then they took out the three sacks of gold from the hiding place which was known </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">only to them and their victim. It was such a rapid, methodical, and brutal action that it was like a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">181 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">military operation. Aureliano, shut up in his room, was not aware of anything. That afternoon, hav&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ing missed him in the kitchen, he looked for Jose Arcadio all over the house and found him floating </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the perfumed mirror of the pool, enormous and bloated and still thinking about Amaranta. Only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then did he understand how much he had began to love him. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">182 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 19 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">AMARANTA URSULA returned with the angels of December, driven on a sailor&rsquo;s breeze, leading her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband by a silk rope tied around his neck. She appeared without warning, wearing an ivory- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">colored dress, a string of pearls that reached almost to her knees, emerald and topaz rings, and with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her straight hair in a smooth bun held behind her ears by swallow-tail brooches. The man whom she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had married six months before was a thin, older Fleming with the look of a sailor about him. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had only to push open the door to the parlor to realize that her absence had been longer and more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">destructive than she had imagined. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; she shouted, more gay than alarmed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s obvious that there&rsquo;s no woman in this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The baggage would not fit on the porch. Besides Fernanda&rsquo;s old tmnk, which they had sent her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">off to school with, she had two upright tmnks, four large suitcases, a bag for her parasols, eight </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hatboxes, a gigantic cage with half a hundred canaries, and her husband&rsquo;s velocipede, broken down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in a special case which allowed him to carry it like a cello. She did not even take a day of rest after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the long trip. She put on some worn denim overalls that her husband had brought along with other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">automotive items and set about on a new restoration of the house. She scattered the red ants, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had already taken possession of the porch, brought the rose bushes back to life, uprooted the weeds, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and planted ferns, oregano, and begonias again in the pots along the railing. She took charge of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crew of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons, who filled in the cracks in the floor, put doors and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">windows back on their hinges, repaired the furniture, and white-washed the walls inside and out, so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that three months after her arrival one breathed once more the atmosphere of youth and festivity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that had existed during the days of the pianola. No one in the house had ever been in a better mood </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at all hours and under any circumstances, nor had anyone ever been readier to sing and dance and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">toss all items and customs from the past into the trash. With a sweep of her broom she did away </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the funeral mementos and piles of useless trash and articles of superstition that had been piling </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up in the corners, and the only thing she spared, out of gratitude to Ursula, was the daguerreotype of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios in the parlor. &ldquo;My, such luxury,&rdquo; she would shout, dying with laughter. &ldquo;A fourteen-year- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">old grandmother!&rdquo; When one of the masons told her that the house was full of apparitions and that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the only way to drive them out was to look for the treasures they had left buried, she replied amid </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">loud laughter that she did not think it was right for men to be superstitious. She was so spontaneous, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so emancipated, with such a free and modern spirit, that Aureliano did not know what to do with his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">body when he saw her arrive. &ldquo;My, my!&rdquo; she shouted happily with open arms. &ldquo;Look at how my </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">darling cannibal has grown!&rdquo; Before he had a chance to react she had already put a record on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">portable phonograph she had brought with her and was trying to teach him the latest dance steps. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She made him change the dirty pants that he had inherited from Colonel Aureliano Buendfa and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gave him some youthful shirts and two-toned shoes, and she would push him into the street when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he was spending too much time in Melquiades&rsquo; room. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Active, small, and indomitable like Ursula, and almost as pretty and provocative as Remedios the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beauty, she was endowed with a rare instinct for anticipating fashion. When she received pictures of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the most recent fashions in the mail, they only proved that she had not been wrong about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">models that she designed herself and sewed on Amaranta&rsquo;s primitive pedal machine. She subscribed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to every fashion magazine, art publication, and popular music review published in Europe, and she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had only to glance at them to realize that things in the world were going just as she imagined they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were. It was incomprehensible why a woman with that spirit would have returned to a dead town </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burdened by dust and heat, and much less with a husband who had more than enough money to live </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">183 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anywhere in the world and who loved her so much that he let himself be led around by her on a silk </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leash. As time passed, however, her intention to stay was more obvious, because she did not make </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">any plans that were not a long way off, nor did she do anything that did not have as an aim the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">search for a comfortable life and a peaceful old age in Macondo. The canary cage showed that those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">aims were made up on the spur of the moment. Remembering that her mother had told her in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letter about the extermination of the birds, she had delayed her trip several months until she found a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ship that stopped at the Fortunate Isles and there she chose the finest twenty-five pairs of canaries </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so that she could repopulate the skies of Macondo. That was the most lamentable of her numerous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frustrated undertakings. As the birds reproduced Amaranta Ursula would release them in pairs, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no sooner did they feel themselves free than they fled the town. She tried in vain to awaken love in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them by means of the bird cage that Ursula had built during the first reconstruction of the house. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also in vain were the artificial nests built of esparto grass in the almond trees and the birdseed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strewn about the roofs, and arousing the captives so that their songs would dissuade the deserters, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because they would take flights on their first attempts and make a turn in the sky, just the time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">needed to find the direction to the Fortunate Isles. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A year after her return, although she had not succeeded in making any friends or giving any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parties, Amaranta Ursula still believed that it was possible to rescue the community which had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">singled out by misfortune. Gaston, her husband, took care not to antagonize her, although since that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fatal noon when he got off the train he realized that his wife&rsquo;s determination had been provoked by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a nostalgic mirage. Certain that she would be defeated by the realities, he did not even take the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trouble to put his velocipede together, but he set about hunting for the largest eggs among the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spider webs that the masons had knocked down, and he would open them with his fingernails and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spend hours looking through a magnifying glass at the tiny spiders that emerged. Later on, thinking </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Amaranta Ursula was continuing with her repairs so that her hands would not be idle, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">decided to assemble the handsome bicycle, on which the front wheel was much larger than the rear </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one, and he dedicated himself to the capture and curing of every native insect he could find in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">region, which he sent in jam jars to his former professor of natural history at the University of Liege </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">where he had done advanced work in entomology, although his main vocation was that of aviator. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he rode the bicycle he would wear acrobat&rsquo;s tights, gaudy socks, and a Sherlock Holmes cap, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but when he was on foot he would dress in a spotless natural linen suit, white shoes, a silk bow tie, a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">straw boater, and he would carry a willow stick in his hand. His pale eyes accentuated his look of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sailor and his small mustache looked like the fur of a squirrel. Although he was at least fifteen years </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">older than his wife, his alert determination to make her happy and his qualities as a good lover </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">compensated for the difference. Actually, those who saw that man in his forties with careful habits, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the leash around his neck and his circus bicycle, would not have thought that he had made a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pact of unbridled love with his wife and that they both gave in to the reciprocal drive in the least </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">adequate of places and wherever the spirit moved them, as they had done since they had began to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">keep company, and with a passion that the passage of time and the more and more unusual </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">circumstances deepened and enriched. Gaston was not only a fierce lover, with endless wisdom and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">imagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first man in the history of the species who had made an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">emergency landing and had come close to killing himself and his sweetheart simply to make love in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">field of violets. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had met two years before they were married, when the sports biplane in which he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">making rolls over the school where Amaranta Ursula was studying made an intrepid maneuver to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">avoid the flagpole and the primitive framework of canvas and aluminum foil was caught by the tail </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on some electric wires. From then on, paying no attention to his leg in splints, on weekends he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would pick up Amaranta Ursula at the nun&rsquo;s boardinghouse where she lived, where the rules were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not as severe as Fernanda had wanted, and he would take her to his country club. They began to </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">184 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">love each other at an altitude of fifteen hundred feet in the Sunday air of the moors, and they felt all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the closer together as the beings on earth grew more and more minute. She spoke to him of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo as the brightest and most peaceful town on earth, and of an enormous house, scented </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with oregano, where she wanted to live until old age with a loyal husband and two strong sons who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, never Aureliano and Jose Arcadio, and a daughter who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be named Virginia and never Remedios. She had evoked the town idealized by nostalgia with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">such strong tenacity that Gaston understood that she would not get married unless he took her to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">live in Macondo. He agreed to it, as he agreed later on to the leash, because he thought it was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passing fancy that could be overcome in time. But when two years in Macondo had passed and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta Ursula was as happy as on the first day, he began to show signs of alarm. By that time he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had dissected every dissectible insect in the region, he spoke Spanish like a native, and he had solved </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">all of the crossword puzzles in the magazines that he received in the mail. He did not have the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pretext of climate to hasten their return because nature had endowed him with a colonial liver which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">resisted the drowsiness of siesta time and water that had vinegar worms in it. He liked the native </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cooking so much that once he ate eighty-two iguana eggs at one sitting. Amaranta Ursula, on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other hand, had brought in by train fish and shellfish in boxes of ice, canned meats and preserved </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fruits, which were the only things she could eat, and she still dressed in European style and received </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">designs by mail in spite of the fact that she had no place to go and no one to visit and by that time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her husband was not in a mood to appreciate her short skirts, her tilted felt hat, and her seven-strand </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">necklaces. Her secret seemed to lie in the fact that she always found a way to keep busy, resolving </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">domestic problems that she herself had created, and doing a poor job on a thousand things which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she would fix on the following day with a pernicious diligence that made one think of Fernanda and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the hereditary vice of making something just to unmake it. Her festive genius was still so alive then </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that when she received new records she would invite Gaston to stay in the parlor until very late to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">practice the dance steps that her schoolmates described to her in sketches and they would generally </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">end up making love on the Viennese rocking chairs or on the bare floor. The only thing that she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">needed to be completely happy was the birth of her children, but she respected the pact she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made with her husband not to have any until they had been married for five years. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking for something to fill his idle hours with, Gaston became accustomed to spending the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morning in Melqufades&rsquo; room with the shy Aureliano. He took pleasure in recalling with him the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">most hidden corners of his country, which Aureliano knew as if he had spent much time there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Gaston asked him what he had done to obtain knowledge that was not in the encyclopedia, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he received the same answer as Jose Arcadio: &ldquo;Everything Is known.&rdquo; In addition to Sanskrit he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">learned English and French and a little Latin and Greek. Since he went out every afternoon at that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time and Amaranta Ursula had set aside a weekly sum for him for his personal expenses, his room </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looked like a branch of the wise Catalonian&rsquo;s bookstore. He read avidly until late at night, although </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the manner in which he referred to his reading, Gaston thought that he did not buy the books </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in order to learn but to verify the tmth of his knowledge, and that none of them interested him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more than the parchments, to which he dedicated most of his time in the morning. Both Gaston and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his wife would have liked to incorporate him into the family life, but Aureliano was a hermetic man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a cloud of mystery that time was making denser. It was such an unfathomable condition that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaston failed in his efforts to become intimate with him and had to seek other pastimes for his idle </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hours. It was around that time that he conceived the idea of establishing an airmail service. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not a new project. Actually, he had it fairly well advanced when he met Amaranta Ursula, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">except that it was not for Macondo, but for the Belgian Congo, where his family had investments in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">palm oil. The marriage and the decision to spend a few months in Macondo to please his wife had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">obliged him to postpone it. But when he saw that Amaranta Ursula was determined to organize a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">commission for public improvement and even laughed at him when he hinted at the possibility of </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">185 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returning, he understood that things were going to take a long time and he reestablished contact </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with his forgotten partners in Brussels, thinking that it was just as well to be a pioneer in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Caribbean as in Africa. While his steps were progressing he prepared a landing field in the old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enchanted region which at that time looked like a plain of crushed flintstone, and he studied the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wind direction, the geography of the coastal region, and the best routes for aerial navigation, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knowing that his diligence, so similar to that of Mr. Herbert, was filling the town with the dangerous </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suspicion that his plan was not to set up routes but to plant banana trees. Enthusiastic over the idea </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that, after all, might justify his permanent establishment in Macondo, he took several trips to the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">capital of the province, met with authorities, obtained licenses, and drew up contracts for exclusive </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rights. In the meantime he maintained a correspondence with his partners in Brussels which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">resembled that of Fernanda with the invisible doctors, and he finally convinced them to ship the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first airplane under the care of an expert mechanic, who would assemble it in the nearest port and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fly it to Macondo. One year after his first meditations and meteorological calculations, trusting in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">repeated promises of his correspondents, he had acquired the habit of strolling through the streets, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">looking at the sky, hanging onto the sound of the breeze in hopes that the airplane would appear. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she had not noticed it, the return of Amaranta Ursula had brought on a radical change </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in Aureliano&rsquo;s life. After the death of Jose Arcadio he had become a regular customer at the wise </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Catalonian&rsquo;s bookstore. Also, the freedom that he enjoyed then and the time at his disposal awoke in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him a certain curiosity about the town, which he came to know without any surprise. He went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">through the dusty and solitary streets, examining with scientific interest the inside of houses in min, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the metal screens on the windows broken by mst and the dying birds, and the inhabitants bowed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down by memories. He tried to reconstruct in his imagination the annihilated splendor of the old </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">banana-company town, whose dry swimming pool was filled to the brim with rotting men&rsquo;s and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">women&rsquo;s shoes, and in the houses of which, destroyed by rye grass, he found the skeleton of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">German shepherd dog still tied to a ring by a steel chain and a telephone that was ringing, ringing, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ringing until he picked it up and an anguished and distant woman spoke in English, and he said yes, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the strike was over, that three thousand dead people had been thrown into the sea, that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">banana company had left, and that Macondo finally had peace after many years. Those wanderings </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">led him to the prostrate red-light district, where in other times bundles of banknotes had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burned to liven up the revels, and which at that time was a maze of streets more afflicted and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">miserable than the others, with a few red lights still burning and with deserted dance halls adorned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the remnants of wreaths, where the pale, fat widows of no one, the French great-grandmothers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the Babylonian matriarchs, were still waiting beside their photographs. Aureliano could not find </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anyone who remembered his family, not even Colonel Aureliano Buendia, except for the oldest of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the West Indian Negroes, an old man whose cottony hair gave him the look of a photographic nega&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tive and who was still singing the mournful sunset psalms in the door of his house. Aureliano would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">talk to him in the tortured Papiamento that he had learned in a few weeks and sometimes he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">share his chicken-head soup, prepared by the great-granddaughter, with him. She was a large black </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman with solid bones, the hips of a mare, teats like live melons, and a round and perfect head </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">armored with a hard surface of wiry hair which looked like a medieval warrior&rsquo;s mail headdress. Her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">name was Nigromanta. In those days Aureliano lived off the sale of silverware, candlesticks, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other bric-a-brac from the house. When he was penniless, which was most of the time, he got </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people in the back of the market to give him the chicken heads that they were going to throw away </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he would take them to Nigromanta to make her soups, fortified with purslane and seasoned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with mint. When the great-grandfather died Aureliano stopped going by the house, but he would run </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into Nigromanta under the dark almond trees on the square, using her wild-animal whistles to lure </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the few night owls. Many times he stayed with her, speaking in Papiamento about chicken-head soup </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and other dainties of misery, and he would have kept right on if she had not let him know that his </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">186 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">presence frightened off customers. Although he sometimes felt the temptation and although </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nigromanta herself might have seemed to him as the natural culmination of a shared nostalgia, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did not go to bed with her. So Aureliano was still a virgin when Amaranta Ursula returned to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo and gave him a sisterly embrace that left him breathless. Every time he saw her, and worse </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">yet when she showed him the latest dances, he felt the same spongy release in his bones that had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disturbed his great-great-grandfather when Pilar Ternera made her pretexts about the cards in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">granary. Trying to squelch the torment, he sank deeper into the parchments and eluded the innocent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flattery of that aunt who was poisoning his nights with a flow of tribulation, but the more he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">avoided her the more the anxiety with which he waited for her stony laughter, her howls of a happy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cat, and her songs of gratitude, agonizing in love at all hours and in the most unlikely parts of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house. One night thirty feet from his bed, on the silver workbench, the couple with unhinged bellies </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">broke the bottles and ended up making love in a pool of muriatic acid. Aureliano not only could not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sleep for a single second, but he spent the next day with a fever, sobbing with rage. The first night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he waited for Nigromanta to come to the shadows of the almond trees it seemed like an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eternity, pricked as he was by the needles of uncertainty and clutching in his fist the peso and fifty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cents that he had asked Amaranta Ursula for, not so much because he needed it as to involve her, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">debase her, prostitute her in his adventure in some way. Nigromanta took him to her room, which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was lighted with false candlesticks, to her folding cot with the bedding stained from bad loves, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to her body of a wild dog, hardened and without soul, which prepared itself to dismiss him as if he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were a frightened child, and suddenly it found a man whose tremendous power demanded a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">movement of seismic readjustment from her insides. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They became lovers. Aureliano would spend his mornings deciphering parchments and at siesta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time he would go to the bedroom where Nigromanta was waiting for him, to teach him first how to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">do it like earthworms, then like snails, and finally like crabs, until she had to leave him and lie in wait </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for vagabond loves. Several weeks passed before Aureliano discovered that around her waist she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wore a small belt that seemed to be made out of a cello string, but which was hard as steel and had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no end, as if it had been born and grown with her. Almost always, between loves, they would eat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">naked in the bed, in the hallucinating heat and under the daytime stars that the mst had caused to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shine on the zinc ceiling. It was the first time that Nigromanta had had a steady man, a bone cmsher </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from head to toe, as she herself said, dying with laughter, and she had even begun to get romantic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">illusions when Aureliano confided in her about his repressed passion for Amaranta Ursula, which he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not been able to cure with the substitution but which was twisting him inside all the more as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">experience broadened the horizons of love. After that Nigromanta continued to receive him with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the same warmth as ever but she made him pay for her services so strictly that when Aureliano had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no money she would make an addition to his bill, which was not figured in numbers but by marks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she made with her thumbnail behind the door. At sundown, while she was drifting through the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shadows in the square, Aureliano, was going along the porch like a stranger, scarcely greeting </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta Ursula and Gaston, who usually dined at that time, and shutting herself up in his room </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again, unable to read or write or even think because of the anxiety brought on by the laughter, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whispering, the preliminary frolics, and then the explosions of agonizing happiness that capped the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nights in the house. That was his life two years before Gaston began to wait for the airplane, and it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went on the same way on the afternoon that he went to the bookstore of the wise Catalonian and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found four ranting boys in a heated argument about the methods used to kill cockroaches in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Middle Ages. The old bookseller, knowing about Aureliano&rsquo;s love for books that had been read only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the Venerable Bede, urged him with a certain fatherly malice to get into the discussion, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">without even taking a breath, he explained that the cockroach, the oldest winged insect on the face </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the earth, had already been the victim of slippers in the Old Testament, but that since the species </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was definitely resistant to any and all methods of extermination, from tomato dices with borax to </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">187 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">flour and sugar, and with its one thousand six hundred three varieties had resisted the most ancient, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tenacious, and pitiless persecution that mankind had unleashed against any living thing since the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beginnings, including man himself, to such an extent that just as an instinct for reproduction was at&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tributed to humankind, so there must have been another one more definite and pressing, which was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the instinct to kill cockroaches, and if the latter had succeeded in escaping human ferocity it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because they had taken refuge in the shadows, where they became invulnerable because of man&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">congenital fear of the dark, but on the other hand they became susceptible to the glow of noon, so </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that by the Middle Ages already, and in present times, and per omnia secula seculomm , the only effective </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">method for killing cockroaches was the glare of the sun. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That encyclopedic coincidence was the beginning of a great friendship. Aureliano continued </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">getting together in the afternoon with the four arguers, whose names were Alvaro, German, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alfonso, and Gabriel, the first and last friends that he ever had in his life. For a man like him, holed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up in written reality, those stormy sessions that began in the bookstore and ended at dawn in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brothels were a revelation. It had never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">best plaything that had ever been invented to make fun of people, as Alvaro demonstrated during </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one night of revels. Some time would have to pass before Aureliano realized that such arbitrary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">attitudes had their origins in the example of the wise Catalonian, for whom wisdom was worth </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nothing if it could not be used to invent a way of preparing chick peas. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The afternoon on which Aureliano gave his lecture on cockroaches, the argument ended up in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house of the girls who went to bed because of hunger, a brothel of lies on the outskirts of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo. The proprietress was a smiling mamasanta , tormented by a mania for opening and closing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">doors. Her eternal smile seemed to have been brought on by the credulity of her customers, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">accepted as something certain an establishment that did not exist except in the imagination, because </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even the tangible things there were unreal: the furniture that fell apart when one sat on it, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disemboweled phonograph with a nesting hen inside, the garden of paper flowers, the calendars </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">going back to the years before the arrival of the banana company, the frames with prints cut out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">magazines that had never been published. Even the timid little whores who came from the neigh&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">borhood: when the proprietress informed them that customers had arrived they were nothing but an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">invention. They would appear without any greeting in their little flowered dresses left over from days </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">when they were five years younger, and they took them off with the same innocence with which they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had put them on, and in the paroxysms of love they would exclaim good heavens, look how that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">roof is falling in, and as soon as they got their peso and fifty cents they would spend it on a roll with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cheese that the proprietress sold them, smiling more than ever, because only she knew that that meal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was not true either. Aureliano, whose world at that time began with Melquiades&rsquo; parchments and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ended in Nigromanta&rsquo;s bed, found a stupid cure for timidity in the small imaginary brothel. At first </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he could get nowhere, in rooms where the proprietress would enter during the best moments of love </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and make all sorts of comments about the intimate charms of the protagonists. But with time he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to get so familiar with those misfortunes of the world that on one night that was more </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unbalanced than the others he got undressed in the small reception room and ran through the house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable maleness. He was the one who made fashionable the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">extravagances that the proprietress celebrated with her eternal smile, without protesting, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">believing in them just as when German tried to burn the house down to show that it did not exist, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and as when Alfonso wrung the neck of the parrot and threw it into the pot where the chicken stew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was beginning to boil. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Aureliano felt himself linked to the four friends by a common affection and a common </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solidarity, even to the point where he thought of them as if they were one person, he was closer to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabriel than to the others. The link was born on the night when he casually mentioned Colonel </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano Buendia and Gabriel was the only one who did not think that he was making fun of </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">188 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">somebody. Even the proprietress, who normally did not take part in the conversation argued with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">madam&rsquo;s wrathful passion that Colonel Aureliano Buendla, of whom she had indeed heard speak at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">some time, was a figure invented by the government as a pretext for killing Liberals. Gabriel, on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other hand, did not doubt the reality of Colonel Aureliano Buendia because he had been a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">companion in arms and inseparable friend of his great-great-grandfather Colonel Gerineldo </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marquez. Those fickle tricks of memory were even more critical when the killing of the workers was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brought up. Every time that Aureliano mentioned the matter, not only the proprietress but some </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">people older than she would repudiate the myth of the workers hemmed in at the station and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">train with two hundred cars loaded with dead people, and they would even insist that, after all, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything had been set forth in judicial documents and in primary-school textbooks: that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">banana company had never existed. So that Aureliano and Gabriel were linked by a kind of complic&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ity based on real facts that no one believed in, and which had affected their lives to the point that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">both of them found themselves off course in the tide of a world that had ended and of which only </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the nostalgia remained. Gabriel would sleep wherever time overtook him. Aureliano put him up </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">several times in the silver workshop, but he would spend his nights awake, disturbed by the noise of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the dead people who walked through the bedrooms until dawn. Later he turned him over to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nigromanta, who took him to her well-used room when she was free and put down his account with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">vertical marks behind the door in the few spaces left free by Aureliano&rsquo;s debts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In spite of their disordered life, the whole group tried to do something permanent at the urging </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the wise Catalonian. It was he, with his experience as a former professor of classical literature and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his storehouse of rare books, who got them to spend a whole night in search of the thirty-seventh </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dramatic situation in a town where no one had any interest any more in going beyond primary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">school. Fascinated by the discovery of friendship, bewildered by the enchantments of a world which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been forbidden to him by Fernanda&rsquo;s meanness, Aureliano abandoned the scmtiny of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parchments precisely when they were beginning to reveal themselves as predictions in coded lines of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">poetry. But the subsequent proof that there was time enough for everything without having to give </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up the brothels gave him the drive to return to Melquiades&rsquo; room, having decided not to flag in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">efforts until he had discovered the last keys. That was during the time that Gaston began to wait for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the airplane and Amaranta Ursula was so lonely that one morning she appeared in the room. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, cannibal,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Back in your cave again?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was irresistible, with a dress she had designed and one of the long shad-vertebra necklaces </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that she herself had made. She had stopped using the leash, convinced of her husband&rsquo;s faithfulness, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and for the first time since her return she seemed to have a moment of ease. Aureliano did not need </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to see her to know that she had arrived. She put her elbows on the table, so close and so helpless </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Aureliano heard the deep sound of her bones, and she became interested in the parchments. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trying to overcome his disturbance, he grasped at the voice that he was losing, the life that was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">leaving him, the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her about the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">priestly destiny of Sanskrit, the scientific possibility of seeing the future showing through in time as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one sees what is written on the back of a sheet of paper through the light, the necessity of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deciphering the predictions so that they would not defeat themselves, and the Centuries of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nostradamus and the destruction of Cantabria predicted by Saint Milanus. Suddenly, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interrupting the chat, moved by an impulse that had been sleeping in him since his origins, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano put his hand on hers, thinking that that final decision would put an end to Iris doubts. She </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grabbed his index finger with the affectionate innocence with which she had done so in childhood, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">however, and she held it while he kept on answering questions. They remained like that, linked by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">icy index fingers that did not transmit anything in any way until she awoke from her momentary </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dream and slapped her forehead with her hand. &ldquo;The ants!&rdquo; she exclaimed. And then she forgot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">about the manuscripts, went to the door with a dance step, and from there she threw Aureliano a </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">189 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kiss with the tips of her fingers as she had said good-bye to her father on the afternoon when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sent her to Brussels. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can tell me later,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I forgot that today&rsquo;s the day to put quicklime on the anthills.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She continued going to the room occasionally when she had something to do in that part of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">house and she would stay there for a few minutes while her husband continued to scrutinize the sky. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Encouraged by that change, Aureliano stayed to eat with the family at that time as he had not done </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since the first months of Amaranta Ursula&rsquo;s return. Gaston was pleased. During the conversations </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">after meals, which usually went on for more than an hour, he complained that his partners were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deceiving him. They had informed him of the loading of the airplane on board a ship that did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arrive, and although his shipping agents insisted, that it would never arrive because it was not on the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">list of Caribbean ships, his partners insisted that the shipment was correct and they even insinuated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Gaston was lying to them in his letters. The correspondence reached such a degree of mutual </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">suspicion that Gaston decided not to write again and he began to suggest the possibility of a quick </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trip to Brussels to clear things up and return with the airplane. The plan evaporated, however, as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soon as Amaranta Ursula reiterated her decision not to move from Macondo even if she lost a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband. During the first days Aureliano shared the general opinion that Gaston was a fool on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">velocipede, and that brought on a vague feeling of pity. Later, when he obtained deeper information </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the nature of men in the brothels, he thought that Gaston&rsquo;s meekness had its origins in unbridled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passion. But when he came to know him better and realized his tme character was the opposite of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his submissive conduct, he conceived the malicious suspicion that even the wait for the airplane was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an act. Then he thought that Gaston was not as foolish as he appeared, but, quite the contrary, was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">man of infinite steadiness, ability, and patience who had set about to conquer his wife with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">weariness of eternal agreement, of never saying no, of simulating a limitless conformity, letting her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">become enmeshed in her own web until the day she could no longer bear the tedium of the illusions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">close at hand and would pack the bags herself to go back to Europe. Aureliano&rsquo;s former pity turned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into a violent dislike. Gaston&rsquo;s system seemed so perverse to him, but at the same time so effective, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he ventured to warn Amaranta Ursula. She made fun of his suspicions, however, without even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">noticing the heavyweight of love, uncertainty, and jealousy that he had inside. It had not occurred to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her that she was arousing something more than fraternal affection in Aureliano until she pricked her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finger trying to open a can of peaches and he dashed over to suck the blood out with an avidity and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a devotion that sent a chill up her spine. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aureliano!&rdquo; She laughed, disturbed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too suspicious to be a good bat.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Aureliano went all out. Giving her some small, orphaned kisses in the hollow of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wounded hand, he opened up the most hidden passageways of his heart and drew out an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">interminable and lacerated intestine, the terrible parasitic animal that had incubated in his mar&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tyrdom. He told her how he would get up at midnight to weep in loneliness and rage over the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">underwear that she had left to dry in the bathroom. He told her about the anxiety with which he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked Nigromanta to howl like a cat and sob gaston gaston gaston in his ear, and with how much </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">astuteness he had ransacked her vials of perfume so that he could smell it on the necks of the little </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">girls who went to bed because of hunger. Frightened by the passion of that outburst, Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was closing her fingers, contracting them like a shellfish until her wounded hand, free of all </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pain and any vestige of pity, was converted into a knot of emeralds and topazes and stony and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unfeeling bones. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she said as if she were spitting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sailing on the first ship leaving for Belgium.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvaro had come to the wise Catalonian&rsquo;s bookstore one of those afternoons proclaiming at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">top of his lungs his latest discovery: a zoological brothel. It was called The Golden Child and it was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a huge open air salon through which no less than two hundred bitterns who told the time with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deafening cackling strolled at will. In wire pens that surrounded the dance floor and among large </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">190 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amazonian camellias there were herons of different colors, crocodiles as fat as pigs, snakes with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">twelve rattles, and a turtle with a gilded shell who dove in a small artificial ocean. There was a big </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">white dog, meek and a pederast, who would give stud services nevertheless in order to be fed. The </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">atmosphere had an innocent denseness, as if it had just been created, and the beautiful mulatto girls </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who waited hopelessly among the blood-red petals and the outmoded phonograph records knew </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ways of love that man had left behind forgotten in the earthly paradise. The first night that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">group visited that greenhouse of illusions the splendid and taciturn old woman who guarded the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">entrance in a wicker rocking chair felt that time was turning back to its earliest origins when among </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the five who were arriving she saw a bony, jaundiced man with Tartar cheekbones, marked forever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and from the beginning of the world with the pox of solitude. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;Aureliano!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was seeing Colonel Aureliano Buendia once more as she had seen him in the light of a lamp </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">long before the wars, long before the desolation of glory and the exile of disillusionment, that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">remote dawn when he went to her bedroom to give the first command of his life: the command to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">give him love. It was Pilar Ternera. Years before, when she had reached one hundred forty-five years </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of age, she had given up the pernicious custom of keeping track of her age and she went on living in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the static and marginal time of memories, in a future perfectly revealed and established, beyond the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">futures disturbed by the insidious snares and suppositions of her cards. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that night on Aureliano, took refuge in the compassionate tenderness and understanding of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his unknown great-great-grandmother. Sitting in her wicker rocking chair, she would recall the past, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reconstmct the grandeur and misfortunes of the family and the splendor of Macondo, which was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">now erased, while Alvaro frightened the crocodiles with his noisy laughter and Alfonso invented </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">outlandish stories about the bitterns who had pecked out the eyes of four customers who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">misbehaved the week before, and Gabriel was in the room of the pensive mulatto girl who did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">collect in money but in letters to a smuggler boyfriend who was in prison on the other side of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Orinoco because the border guards had caught him and had made him sit on a chamberpot that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">filled up with a mixture of shit and diamonds. That true brothel, with that maternal proprietress, was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the world of which Aureliano had dreamed during his prolonged captivity. He felt so well, so close </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to perfect companionship, that he thought of no other refuge on the afternoon on which Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula had made his illusions crumble. He was ready to unburden himself with words so that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">someone could break the knots that bound his chest, but he only managed to let out a fluid, warm, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and restorative weeping in Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s lap. She let him finish, scratching his head with the tips of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her fingers, and without his having revealed that he was weeping from love, she recognized </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">immediately the oldest sobs in the history of man. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, child,&rdquo; she consoled him. &ldquo;Now tell me who it is.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Aureliano told her, Pilar Ternera let out a deep laugh, the old expansive laugh that ended </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up as a cooing of doves. There was no mystery in the heart of a Buendia that was impenetrable for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her because a century of cards and experience had taught her that the history of the family was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">machine with unavoidable repetitions, a turning wheel that would have gone on spilling into eternity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were it not for the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;Wherever she is right now, she&rsquo;s waiting for you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was half past four in the afternoon when Amaranta Ursula came out of her bath. Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saw her go by his room with a robe of soft folds and a towel wrapped around her head like a turban. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He followed her almost on tiptoes, stumbling from dmnkenness, and he went into the nuptial </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bedroom just as she opened the robe and closed it again in fright. He made a silent signal toward the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">next room where the door was half open and where Aureliano knew that Gaston was beginning to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">write a letter. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she said voicelessly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">191 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, smiled, picked her up by the waist with both hands like a pot of begonias, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dropped her on her back on the bed. With a brutal tug he pulled off her bathrobe before she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time to resist and he loomed over an abyss of newly washed nudity whose skin color, lines of fuzz, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and hidden moles had all been imagined in the shadows of the other rooms. Amaranta Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">defended herself sincerely with the astuteness of a wise woman, weaseling her slippery, flexible, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fragrant weasel&rsquo;s body as she tried to knee him in the kidneys and scorpion his face with her nails, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but without either of them giving a gasp that might not have been taken for that breathing of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">person watching the meager April sunset through the open window. It was a fierce fight, a battle to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the death, but it seemed to be without violence because it consisted of distorted attacks and ghostly </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">evasions, slow, cautious, solemn, so that during it all there was time for the petunias to bloom and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for Gaston to forget about his aviator&rsquo;s dream in the next room, as if they were two enemy lovers </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seeking reconciliation at the bottom of an aquarium. In the heat of that savage and ceremonious </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">struggle, Amaranta Ursula understood that her meticulous silence was so irrational that it could </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">awaken the suspicions of her nearby husband much more than the sound of warfare that they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trying to avoid. Then she began to laugh with her lips tight together, without giving up the fight, but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">defending herself with false bites and deweaseling her body little by little until they both were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conscious of being adversaries and accomplices at the same time and the affray degenerated into a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">conventional gambol and the attacks became caresses. Suddenly, almost playfully, like one more bit </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of mischief, Amaranta Ursula dropped her defense, and when she tried to recover, frightened by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">what she herself had made possible, it was too late. A great commotion immobilized her in her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">center of gravity, planted her in her place, and her defensive will was demolished by the irresistible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">anxiety to discover what the orange whistles and the invisible globes on the other side of death were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">like. She barely had time to reach out her hand and grope for the towel to put a gag between her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">teeth so that she would not let out the cat howls that were already tearing at her insides. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">192 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 20 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PILAR TERNERA died in her wicker rocking chair during one night of festivities as she watched over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the entrance to her paradise. In accordance with her last wishes she was not buried in a coffin but </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sitting in her rocker, which eight men lowered by ropes into a huge hole dug in the center of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dance floor. The mulatto girls, dressed in black, pale from weeping, invented shadowy rites as they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took off their earrings, brooches, and rings and threw them into the pit before it was closed over </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with a slab that bore neither name nor dates, and that was covered with a pile of Amazonian </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">camellias. After poisoning the animals they closed up the doors and windows with brick and mortar </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and they scattered out into the world with their wooden trunks that were lined with pictures of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">saints, prints from magazines, and the portraits of sometime sweethearts, remote and fantastic, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shat diamonds, or ate cannibals, or were crowned playing-card kings on the high seas. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the end. In Pilar Ternera&rsquo;s tomb, among the psalm and cheap whore jewelry, the ruins of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the past would rot, the little that remained after the wise Catalonian had auctioned off his bookstore </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and returned to the Mediterranean village where he had been born, overcome by a yearning for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lasting springtime. No one could have foreseen his decision. He had arrived in Macondo during the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">splendor of the banana company, fleeing from one of many wars, and nothing more practical had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">occurred to him than to set up that bookshop of incunabula and first editions in several languages, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which casual customers would thumb through cautiously, as if they were junk books, as they waited </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their turn to have their dreams interpreted in the house across the way. He spent half his life in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back of the store, scribbling in his extra-careful hand in purple ink and on pages that he tore out of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">school notebooks, and no one was sure exactly what he was writing. When Aureliano first met him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he had two boxes of those motley pages that in some way made one think of Melquiades&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">parchments, and from that time until he left he had filled a third one, so it was reasonable to believe </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that he had done nothing else during his stay in Macondo. The only people with whom he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">maintained relations were the four friends, whom he had exchanged their tops and kites for books, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he set them to reading Seneca and Ovid while they were still in grammar school. He treated the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">classical writers with a household familiarity, as if they had all been his roommates at some period, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he knew many tilings that should not have been known, such as the fact that Saint Augustine </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wore a wool jacket under his habit that he did not take off for fourteen years and that Arnaldo of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Villanova, the necromancer, was impotent since childhood because of a scorpion bite. His fervor for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the written word was an interweaving of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence. Not even his own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">manuscripts were safe from that dualism. Having learned Catalan in order to translate them, Alfonso </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">put a roll of pages in his pockets, which were always full of newspaper clippings and manuals for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">strange trades, and one night he lost them in the house of the little girls who went to bed because of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hunger. When the wise old grandfather found out, instead of raising a row as had been feared, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">commented, dying with laughter, that it was the natural destiny of literature. On the other hand, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there was no human power capable of persuading him not to take along the three boxes when he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returned to his native village, and he unleashed a string of Carthaginian curses at the railroad </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inspectors who tried to ship them as freight until he finally succeeded in keeping them with him in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the passenger coach. &ldquo;The world must be all fucked up,&rdquo; he said then, &ldquo;when men travel first class </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and literature goes as freight.&rdquo; That was the last tiling he was heard to say. He had spent a dark week </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on the final preparations for the trip, because as the hour approached his humor was breaking down </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and things began to be misplaced, and what he put in one place would appear in another, attacked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the same elves that had tormented Fernanda. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; Collons ,&rdquo; he would curse. &ldquo;I shit on Canon Twenty-seven of the Synod of London.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">193 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">German and Aureliano took care of him. They helped him like a child, fastening Inis tickets and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">immigration documents to his pockets with safety pins, making him a detailed list of what he must </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">do from the time he left Macondo until he landed in Barcelona, but nonetheless he threw away a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pair of pants with half of Inis money in it without realizing it. The night before the trip, after nailing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up the boxes and putting his clothing into the same suitcase that he had brought when he first came, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he narrowed his clam eyes, pointed with a kind of impudent benediction at the stacks of books with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which he had endured during his exile, and said to Inis friends: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All that shit there I leave to you people!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three months later they received in a large envelope twenty-nine letters and more than fifty </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pictures that he had accumulated during the leisure of the high seas. Although he did not date them, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the order in which he had written the letters was obvious. In the first ones, with his customary good </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">humor, he spoke about the difficulties of the crossing, the urge he had to throw the cargo officer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">overboard when he would not let him keep the three boxes in his cabin, the clear imbecility of a lady </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who was terrified at the number thirteen, not out of superstition but because she thought it was a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">number that had no end, and the bet that he had won during the first dinner because he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recognized in the drinking water on board the taste of the nighttime beets by the springs of Lerida. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the passage of the days, however, the reality of life on board mattered less and less to him and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">even the most recent and trivial happenings seemed worthy of nostalgia, because as the ship got </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">farther away, his memory began to grow sad. That process of nostalgia was also evident in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pictures. In the first ones he looked happy, with his sport shirt which looked like a hospital jacket </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and his snowy mane, in an October Caribbean filled with whitecaps. In the last ones he could be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seen to be wearing a dark coat and a milk scarf, pale in the face, taciturn from absence on the deck </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a mournful ship that had come to be like a sleepwalker on the autumnal seas. German and Aureli&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ano answered his letters. He wrote so many during the first months that at that time they felt closer </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to him than when he had been in Macondo, and they were almost freed from the rancor that he had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">left behind. At first he told them that everything was just the same, that the pink snails were still in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the house where he had been born, that the dry herring still had the same taste on a piece of toast, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that the waterfalls in the village still took on a perfumed smell at dusk. They were the notebook </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pages again, woven with the purple scribbling, in which he dedicated a special paragraph to each </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one. Nevertheless, and although he himself did not seem to notice it, those letters of recuperation </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and stimulation were slowly changing into pastoral letters of disenchantment. One winter night </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">while the soup was boiling in the fireplace, he missed the heat of the back of his store, the buzzing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the sun on the dusty almond trees, the whistle of the train during the lethargy of siesta time, just </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as in Macondo he had missed the winter soup in the fireplace, the cries of the coffee vendor, and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fleeting larks of springtime. Upset by two nostalgias facing each other like two mirrors, he lost his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">marvelous sense of unreality and he ended up recommending to all of them that they leave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Macondo, that they forget everything he had taught them about the world and the human heart, that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they shit on Horace, and that wherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvaro was the first to take the advice to abandon Macondo. He sold everything, even the tame </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">jaguar that teased passersby from the courtyard of his house, and he bought an eternal ticket on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">train that never stopped traveling. In the postcards that he sent from the way stations he would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">describe with shouts the instantaneous images that he had seen from the window of his coach, and it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was as if he were tearing up and throwing into oblivion some long, evanescent poem: the chimerical </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Negroes in the cotton fields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the bluegrass of Kentucky, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Greek lovers in the infernal sunsets of Arizona, the girl in the red sweater painting watercolors by a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lake in Michigan who waved at him with her bmshes, not to say farewell but out of hope, because </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">194 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she did not know that she was watching a train with no return passing by. Then Alfonso and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">German left one Saturday with the idea of coming back on Monday, but nothing more was ever </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heard of them. A year after the departure of the wise Catalonian the only one left in Macondo was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabriel, still adrift at the mercy of Nigromanta&rsquo;s chancy charity and answering the questions of a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contest in a French magazine in which the first prize was a trip to Paris. Aureliano, who was the one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who subscribed to it, helped him fill in the answers, sometimes in his house but most of the time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">among the ceramic bottles and atmosphere of valerian in the only pharmacy left in Macondo, where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mercedes, Gabriel&rsquo;s stealthy girl friend, lived. It was the last that remained of a past whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">annihilation had not taken place because it was still in a process of annihilation, consuming itself </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">from within, ending at every moment but never ending its ending. The town had reached such </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">extremes of inactivity that when Gabriel won the contest and left for Paris with two changes of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clothing, a pair of shoes, and the complete works of Rabelais, he had to signal the engineer to stop </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the train and pick him up. The old Street of the Turks was at that time an abandoned corner where </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the last Arabs were letting themselves be dragged off to death with the age-old custom of sitting in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their doorways, although it had been many years since they had sold the last yard of diagonal cloth, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and in the shadowy showcases only the decapitated manikins remained. The banana company&rsquo;s city, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which Patricia Brown may have tried to evoke for her grandchildren during the nights of intolerance </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and dill pickles in Prattville, Alabama, was a plain of wild grass. The ancient priest who had taken </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Father Angel&rsquo;s place and whose name no one had bothered to find out awaited God&rsquo;s mercy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stretched out casually in a hammock, tortured by arthritis and the insomnia of doubt while the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lizards and rats fought over the inheritance of the nearby church. In that Macondo forgotten even </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the birds, where the dust and the heat had become so strong that it was difficult to breathe, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">secluded by solitude and love and by the solitude of love in a house where it was almost impossible </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to sleep because of the noise of the red ants, Aureliano, and Amaranta Ursula were the only happy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">beings, and the most happy on the face of the earth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaston had returned to Brussels. Tired of waiting for the airplane, one day he put his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">indispensable things into a small suitcase, took his file of correspondence, and left with the idea of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">returning by air before his concession was turned over to a group of German pilots who had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">presented the provincial authorities with a more ambitious project than his. Since the afternoon of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their first love, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula had continued taking advantage of her husband&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rare unguarded moments, making love with gagged ardor in chance meetings and almost always </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">intermpted by unexpected returns. But when they saw themselves alone in the house they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">succumbed to the delirium of lovers who were making up for lost time. It was a mad passion, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">unhinging, which made Fernanda&rsquo;s bones tremble with horror in her grave and which kept them in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">state of perpetual excitement. Amaranta Ursula&rsquo;s shrieks, her songs of agony would break out the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">same at two in the afternoon on the dining-room table as at two in the morning in the pantry. &ldquo;What </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">hurts me most,&rdquo; she would say, laughing, &ldquo;is all the time that we wasted.&rdquo; In the bewilderment of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">passion she watched the ants devastating the garden, sating their prehistoric hunger with the beam </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the house, and she watched the torrents of living lava take over the porch again, but she bothered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to fight them only when she found them in her bedroom. Aureliano abandoned the parchments, did </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">not leave the house again, and carelessly answered the letters from the wise Catalonian. They lost </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their sense of reality, the notion of time, the rhythm of daily habits. They closed the doors and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">windows again so as not to waste time getting undressed and they walked about the house as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remedios the Beauty had wanted to do and they would roll around naked in the mud of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtyard, and one afternoon they almost drowned as they made love in the cistern. In a short time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they did more damage than the red ants: they destroyed the furniture in the parlor, in their madness </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they tore to shreds the hammock that had resisted the sad bivouac loves of Colonel Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Buendfa and they disemboweled the mattresses and emptied them on the floor as they suffocated in </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">195 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">storms of cotton. Although Aureliano was just as ferocious a lover as his rival, it was Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula who ruled in that paradise of disaster with her mad genius and her lyrical voracity, as if she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had concentrated in her love the unconquerable energy that her great-great-grandmother had given </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the making of little candy animals. And yet, while she was singing with pleasure and dying with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laughter over her own inventions, Aureliano was becoming more and more absorbed and silent, for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">his passion was self-centered and burning. Nevertheless, they both reached such extremes of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">virtuosity that when they became exhausted from excitement, they would take advantage of their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fatigue. They would give themselves over to the worship of their bodies, discovering that the rest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">periods of love had unexplored possibilities, much richer than those of desire. While he would rub </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta Ursula&rsquo;s erect breasts with egg whites or smooth her elastic thighs and peach-like stomach </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with cocoa butter, she would play with Aureliano&rsquo;s portentous creature as if it were a doll and would </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">paint clown&rsquo;s eyes on it with her lipstick and give it a Turk&rsquo;s mustache with her eyebrow pencil, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would put on organza bow ties and little tinfoil hats. One night they daubed themselves from head </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to toe with peach jam and licked each other like dogs and made mad love on the floor of the porch, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and they were awakened by a torrent of carnivorous ants who were ready to eat them alive. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the pauses in their delirium, Amaranta Ursula would answer Gaston&rsquo;s letters. She felt him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to be so far away and busy that his return seemed impossible to her. In one of his first letters he told </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">her that his Partners had actually sent the airplane, but that a shipping agent in Bmssels had sent it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by mistake to Tanganyika, where it was delivered to the scattered tribe of the Makondos. That mix- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up brought on so many difficulties that just to get the plane back might take two years. So Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula dismissed the possibility of an inopportune return. Aureliano, for his part, had no other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contact with the world except for the letters from the wise Catalonian and the news he had of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabriel through Mercedes, the silent pharmacist. At first they were real contacts. Gabriel had turned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in his return ticket in order to stay in Paris, selling the old newspapers and empty bottles that the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chambermaids threw out of a gloomy hotel on the Rue Dauphine. Aureliano could visualize him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">then in a turtleneck sweater which he took off only when the sidewalk Cafes on Montparnasse filled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with springtime lovers, and sleeping by day and writing by night in order to confuse hunger in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die. Nevertheless, news about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him was slowly becoming so uncertain, and the letters from the wise man so sporadic and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">melancholy, that Aureliano grew to think about them as Amaranta Ursula thought about her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">husband, and both of them remained floating in an empty universe where the only everyday and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eternal reality was love. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, like the stampede in that world of happy unawareness, came the news of Gaston&rsquo;s </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">return. Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula opened their eyes, dug deep into their souls, looked at the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">letter with their hands on their hearts, and understood that they were so close to each other that they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">preferred death to separation. Then she wrote her husband a letter of contradictory truths in which </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she repeated her love and said how anxious she was to see him again, but at the same time she </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">admitted as a design of fate the impossibility of living without Aureliano. Contrary to what they had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expected, Gaston sent them a calm, almost paternal reply, with two whole pages devoted to a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">warning against the fickleness of passion and a final paragraph with unmistakable wishes for them to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">be as happy as he had been during his brief conjugal experience. It was such an unforeseen attitude </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Amaranta Ursula felt humiliated by the idea that she had given her husband the pretext that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had wanted in order to abandon her to her fate. The rancor was aggravated six months later when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaston wrote again from Leopoldville, where he had finally recovered the airplane, simply to ask </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them to ship him the velocipede, which of all that he had left behind in Macondo was the only thing </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that had any sentimental value for him. Aureliano bore Amaranta Ursula&rsquo;s spite patiently and made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">an effort to show her that he could be as good a husband in adversity as in prosperity, and the daily </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">needs that besieged them when Gaston&rsquo;s last money ran out created a bond of solidarity between </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">196 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them that was not as dazzling and heady as passion, but that let them make love as much and be as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">happy as during their uproarious and salacious days. At the time Pilar Ternera died they were </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">expecting a child. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the lethargy of her pregnancy, Amaranta Ursula tried to set up a business in necklaces made </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out of the backbones of fish. But except for Mercedes, who bought a dozen, she could not find any </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">customers. Aureiiano was aware for the first time that his gift for languages, his encyclopedic </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knowledge, his rare faculty for remembering the details of remote deeds and places without having </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been there, were as useless as the box of genuine jewelry that his wife owned, which must have been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worth as much as all the money that the last inhabitants of Macondo could have put together. They </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">survived miraculously. Although Amaranta Ursula did not lose her good humor or her genius for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">erotic mischief, she acquired the habit of sitting on the porch after lunch in a kind of wakeful and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thoughtful siesta. Aureiiano would accompany her. Sometimes they would remain there in silence </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">until nightfall, opposite each other, looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes, loving each other as much as in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their scandalous days. The uncertainty of the future made them turn their hearts toward the past. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They saw themselves in the lost paradise of the deluge, splashing in the puddles in the courtyard, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">killing lizards to hang on Ursula, pretending that they were going to bury her alive, and those </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memories revealed to them the truth that they had been happy together ever since they had had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">memory. Going deeper into the past, Amaranta Ursula remembered the afternoon on which she had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gone into the silver shop and her mother told her that little Aureiiano was nobody&rsquo;s child because he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had been found floating in a basket. Although the version seemed unlikely to them, they did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have any information enabling them to replace it with the true one. All that they were sure of after </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">examining an the possibilities was that Fernanda was not Aureliano&rsquo;s mother. Amaranta Ursula was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">inclined to believe that he was the son of Petra Cotes, of whom she remembered only tales of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">infamy, and that supposition produced a twinge of horror in her heart. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tormented by the certainty that he was Iris wife&rsquo;s brother, Aureiiano ran out to the parish house </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to search through the moldy and moth-eaten archives for some clue to his parentage. The oldest </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">baptismal certificate that he found was that of Amaranta Buendfa, baptized in adolescence by Father </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicanor Reyna during the time when he was trying to prove the existence of God by means of tricks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with chocolate. He began to have that feeling that he was one of the seventeen Aurelianos, whose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">birth certificates he tracked down as he went through four volumes, but the baptism dates were too </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">far back for his age. Seeing him lost in the labyrinths of kinship, trembling with uncertainty, the arth&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ritic priest, who was watching him from his hammock, asked him compassionately what his name </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aureiiano Buendfa,&rdquo; he said. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t wear yourself out searching,&rdquo; the priest exclaimed with final conviction. &ldquo;Many years </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ago there used to be a street here with that name and in those days people had the custom of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">naming their children after streets.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureiiano trembled with rage. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe it either.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Believe what?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That Colonel Aureiiano, Buendfa fought thirty-two civil wars and lost them all,&rdquo; Aureiiano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">answered. &ldquo;That the army hemmed in and machine-gunned three thousand workers and that their </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bodies were carried off to be thrown into the sea on a train with two hundred cars.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The priest measured him with a pitying look. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, my son,&rdquo; he signed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Aureiiano and Amaranta Ursula accepted the version of the basket, not because they believed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it, but because it spared them their terror. As the pregnancy advanced they were becoming a single </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being, they were becoming more and more integrated in the solitude of a house that needed only </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">197 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one last breath to be knocked down. They restricted themselves to an essential area, from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fernanda&rsquo;s bedroom, where the charms of sedentary love were visible, to the beginning of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">porch, where Amaranta Ursula would sit to sew bootees and bonnets for the newborn baby and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, would answer the occasional letters from the wise Catalonian. The rest of the house was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">given over to the tenacious assault of destmction. The silver shop, Melquiades&rsquo; room, the primitive </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and silent realm of Santa Sofia de la Piedad remained in the depths of a domestic jungle that no one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would have had the courage to penetrate. Surrounded by the voracity of nature, Aureliano and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amaranta Ursula continued cultivating the oregano and the begonias and defended their world with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">demarcations of quicklime, building the last trenches in the age-old war between man and ant. Her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">long and neglected hair, the splotches that were beginning to appear on her face, the swelling of her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">legs, the deformation of her former lovemaking weasel&rsquo;s body had changed Amaranta Ursula from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the youthful creature she had been when she arrived at the house with the cage of luckless canaries </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and her captive husband, but it did not change the vivacity of her spirit. &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she would say, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">laughingly. &ldquo;Who would have thought that we really would end up living like cannibals!&rdquo; The last </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thread that joined them to the world was broken on the sixth month of pregnancy when they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">received a letter that obviously was not from the wise Catalonian. It had been mailed in Barcelona, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but the envelope was addressed in conventional blue ink by an official hand and it had the innocent </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and impersonal look of hostile messages. Aureliano snatched it out of Amaranta Ursula&rsquo;s hands as </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">she was about to open it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not this one,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what it says.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as he had sensed, the wise Catalonian did not write again. The stranger&rsquo;s letter, which no one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">read, was left to the mercy of the moths on the shelf where Fernanda had forgotten her wedding </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ring on occasion and there it remained, consuming itself in the inner fire of its bad news as the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">solitary lovers sailed against the tide of those days of the last stages, those impenitent and ill-fated </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">times which were squandered on the useless effort of making them drift toward the desert of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">disenchantment and oblivion. Aware of that menace, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula spent the hot </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">months holding hands, ending with the love of loyalty for the child who had his beginning in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">madness of fornication. At night, holding each other in bed, they were not frightened by the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sublunary explosions of the ants or the noise of the moths or the constant and clean whistle of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">growth of the weeds in the neighboring rooms. Many times they were awakened by the traffic of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dead. They could hear Ursula fighting against the laws of creation to maintain the line, and Jose </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arcadio Buendia searching for the mythical truth of the great inventions, and Fernanda praying, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Colonel Aureliano Buendia stupefying himself with the deception of war and the little gold fishes, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Aureliano Segundo dying of solitude in the turmoil of his debauches, and then they learned that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dominant obsessions can prevail against death and they were happy again with the certainty that they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would go on loving each other in their shape as apparitions long after other species of future animals </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would steal from the insects the paradise of misery that the insects were finally stealing from man. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One Sunday, at six in the afternoon, Amaranta Ursula felt the pangs of childbirth. The smiling </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mistress of the little girls who went to bed because of hunger had her get onto the dining-room </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">table, straddled her stomach, and mistreated her with wild gallops until her cries were drowned out </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">by the bellows of a formidable male child. Through her tears Amaranta Ursula could see that he was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">one of those great Buendias, strong and willful like the Jose Arcadios, with the open and clairvoyant </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">eyes of the Aurelianos, and predisposed to begin the race again from the beginning and cleanse it of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">its pernicious vices and solitary calling, for he was the only one in a century who had been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">engendered with love. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real cannibal.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll name him Rodrigo.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; her husband countered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll name him Aureliano and he&rsquo;ll win thirty-two wars.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">198 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After cutting the umbilical cord, the midwife began to use a cloth to take off the blue grease that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">covered his body as Aureliano held up a lamp. Only when they turned him on his stomach did they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">see that he had something more than other men, and they leaned over to examine him. It was the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tail of a pig. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were not alarmed. Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula were not aware of the family precedent, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nor did they remember Ursula&rsquo;s frightening admonitions, and the midwife pacified them with the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">idea that the tail could be cut off when the child got his second teeth. Then they had no time to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">think about it again, because Amaranta Ursula was bleeding in an uncontainable torrent. They tried </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to help her with applications of spider webs and balls of ash, but it was like trying to hold back a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">spring with one&rsquo;s hands. During the first hours she tried to maintain her good humor. She took the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">frightened Aureliano by the hand and begged him not to worry, because people like her were not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made to die against their will, and she exploded with laughter at the ferocious remedies of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">midwife. But as Aureliano&rsquo;s hope abandoned him she was becoming less visible, as if the light on her </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were fading away, until she sank into drowsiness. At dawn on Monday they brought a woman who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">recited cauterizing prayers that were infallible for man and beast beside her bed, but Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula&rsquo;s passionate blood was insensible to any artifice that did not come from love. In the after&not; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">noon, after twenty-four hours of desperation, they knew that she was dead because the flow had </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stopped without remedies and her profile became sharp and the blotches on her face evaporated in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">halo of alabaster and she smiled again. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano did not understand until then how much he loved his friends, how much he missed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them, and how much he would have given to be with them at that moment. He put the child in the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">basket that his mother had prepared for him, covered the face of the corpse with a blanket, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wandered aimlessly through the town, searching for an entrance that went back to the past. He </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">knocked at the door of the pharmacy, where he had not visited lately, and he found a carpenter </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shop. The old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took pity on his delirium and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">insisted that, no, there had never been a pharmacy there, nor had she ever known a woman with a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thin neck and sleepy eyes named Mercedes. He wept, leaning his brow against the door of the wise </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Catalonian&rsquo;s former bookstore, conscious that he was paying with his tardy sobs for a death that he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had refused to weep for on time so as not to break the spell of love. He smashed his fists against the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cement wall of The Golden Child, calling for Pilar Ternera, indifferent to the luminous orange disks </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that were crossing the sky and that so many times on holiday nights he had contemplated with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">childish fascination from the courtyard of the curlews. In the last open salon of the tumbledown </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">red-light district an accordion group was playing the songs of Rafael Escalona, the bishop&rsquo;s nephew, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">heir to the secrets of Francisco the Man. The bartender, who had a withered and somewhat </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">crumpled arm because he had raised it against his mother, invited Aureliano to have a bottle of cane </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">liquor, and Aureliano then bought him one. The bartender spoke to him about the misfortune of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">arm. Aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune of his heart, withered and somewhat crumpled </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">for having been raised against his sister. They ended up weeping together and Aureliano felt for a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">moment that the pain was over. But when he was alone again in the last dawn of Macondo, he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">opened up his arms in the middle of the square, ready to wake up the whole world, and he shouted </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with all his might: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Friends are a bunch of bastards!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nigromanta rescued him from a pool of vomit and tears. She took him to her room, cleaned him </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up, made him drink a cup of broth. Thinking that it would console him, she took a piece of charcoal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and erased the innumerable loves that he still owed her for, and she voluntarily brought up her own </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">most solitary sadnesses so as not to leave him alone in his weeping. When he awoke, after a dull and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">brief sleep, Aureliano recovered the awareness of his headache. He opened his eyes and remembered </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the child. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">199 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could not find the basket. At first he felt an outburst of joy, thinking that Amaranta Ursula </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had awakened from death to take care of the child. But her corpse was a pile of stones under the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">blanket. Aware that when he arrived he had found the -door to the bedroom open, Aureliano went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">across the porch which was saturated with the morning sighs of oregano and looked into the dining </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">room, where the remnants of the birth still lay: the large pot, the bloody sheets, the jars of ashes, and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the twisted umbilical cord of the child on an opened diaper on the table next to the shears and the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fishline. The idea that the midwife had returned for the child during the night gave him a pause of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rest in which to think. He sank into the rocking chair, the same one in which Rebeca had sat during </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the early days of the house to give embroidery lessons, and in which Amaranta had played Chinese </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, and in which Amaranta Ursula had sewn the tiny </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clothing for the child, and in that flash of lucidity he became aware that he was unable to bear in his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">soul the crushing weight of so much past. Wounded by the fatal lances of his own nostalgia and that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of others, he admired the persistence of the spider webs on the dead rose bushes, the perseverance </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the rye grass, the patience of the air in the radiant February dawn. And then he saw the child. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a dry and bloated bag of skin that all the ants in the world were dragging toward their holes </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">along the stone path in the garden. Aureliano could not move. Not because he was paralyzed by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">horror but because at that prodigious instant Melqufades&rsquo; final keys were revealed to him and he saw </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man&rsquo;s time and space: The first of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by the ants. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano, had never been more lucid in any act of his life as when he forgot about his dead ones </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the pain of his dead ones and nailed up the doors and windows again with Fernanda&rsquo;s crossed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">boards so as not to be disturbed by any temptations of the world, for he knew then that his fate was </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">written in Melqufades&rsquo; parchments. He found them intact among the prehistoric plants and steaming </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">puddles and luminous insects that had removed all trace of man&rsquo;s passage on earth from the room, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and he did not have the calmness to bring them out into the light, but right there, standing, without </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the slightest difficulty, as if they had been written in Spanish and were being read under the dazzling </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">splendor of high noon, he began to decipher them aloud. It was the history of the family, written by </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Melqufades, down to the most trivial details, one hundred years ahead of time. He had written it in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sanskrit, which was his mother tongue, and he had encoded the even lines in the private cipher of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Emperor Augustus and the odd ones in a Lacedemonian military code. The final protection, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">which Aureliano had begun to glimpse when he let himself be confused by the love of Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula, was based on the fact that Melqufades had not put events in the order of man&rsquo;s conventional </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes in such a way that they coexisted in one </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">instant. Fascinated by the discovery, Aureliano, read aloud without skipping the chanted encyclicals </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that Melqufades himself had made Arcadio listen to and that were in reality the prediction of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">execution, and he found the announcement of the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who was rising up to heaven in body and soul, and he found the origin of the posthumous twins </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">who gave up deciphering the parchments, not simply through incapacity and lack of drive, but also </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because their attempts were premature. At that point, impatient to know his own origin, Aureliano </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">skipped ahead. Then the wind began, warm, incipient, full of voices from the past, the murmurs of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ancient geraniums, sighs of disenchantment that preceded the most tenacious nostalgia. He did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">notice it because at that moment he was discovering the first indications of his own being in a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lascivious grandfather who let himself be frivolously dragged along across a hallucinated plateau in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">search of a beautiful woman who would not make him happy. Aureliano recognized him, he pursued </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the hidden paths of his descent, and he found the instant of his own conception among the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">scorpions and the yellow butterflies in a sunset bathroom where a mechanic satisfied Iris lust on a </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">woman who was giving herself out of rebellion. He was so absorbed that he did not feel the second </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">surge of wind either as its cyclonic strength tore the doors and windows off their hinges, pulled off </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">200 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the roof of the east wing, and uprooted the foundations. Only then did he discover that Amaranta </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ursula was not his sister but his aunt, and that Sir Francis Drake had attacked Riohacha only so that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they could seek each other through the most intricate labyrinths of blood until they would engender </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the mythological animal that was to bring the line to an end. Macondo was already a fearful </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">whirlwind of dust and mbble being spun about by the wrath of the biblical hurricane when </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aureliano skipped eleven pages so as not to lose time with facts he knew only too well, and he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to decipher the instant that he was living, deciphering it as he lived it, prophesying himself in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the act of deciphering the last page of the parchments, as if he were looking into a speaking mirror. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he skipped again to anticipate the predictions and ascertain the date and circumstances of his </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">death. Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he would never leave </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">have a second opportunity on earth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE END. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">201 </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
